10,4,15859,"My opponent is using a huge logical fallacy; he is claiming that because medical marijuana doesn't have medical purposes for all medical conditions that the medical conditions it does have medical purposes for do not count. The fact remains that medical marijuana has several medical purposes such as alleviating neurpathic pain. A ban on medical marijuana would result in the ban of a medicine that works better than any other medicines, resulting in worse health out comes and a worse off health care system. My opponents post is also lying the source i posted studied the addictive potential of some medical marijuana the studies found that certain medical marijuana extracts do not result in addictive properties or addictive behavior. medical marijuana is different then regular marijuana because in medical marijuana they take out the harmful and addictive chemicals and only use the chemicals that have medical purposes. this means that every time my opponent links to marijuana having unhealthy effects he is comparing apples and oranges, and therefore his comparisons are invalid. For example a scientific study found that medial marijuana improved the mental abilities of people with Alzheimers. So basically a ban on medical marijuana would be an example of the government telling doctors how to treat patients. it would also be an example of the government telling millions of sick people that they cannot legally consume medicines that improve their medical condition.",0.8044698538620362,True,1.5350723788957257,0.9522679044804018,0.8817999064814852,234,True,1.2959366627272988

15,6,1349,"Not ALL commercials are inappropriate, and I cannot understand why you insist they are. In addition, the production costs more and is of higher quality, because why would the companies air commercials for millions of dollars when it isnt worth it? (e.i. poor quality...) The only logical way to advertise during the Superbowl is to make commercials that are of great quality, and that catch the eye of the viewers. You misunderstood my first argument. I was not only implying they are inappropriate, but they lack in variety. This has gone untouched. Since they all focus on one SPECIFIC group, they lack in variety. This is bad. But what you did try to attack was the inappropriateness of the commercials. Your only response is that ""not ALL commercials are inappropriate."" Honestly, the majority of them are inappropriate. Thus, they are bad. And finally, the value of the commercial. I understand what you saying, but you are confusing what is wanted to what is actually done. Here is my logic...again...with numbers this time for clarity. Commercial has a budget of $15,000. Normal commercial cost $2,000 to air. Normal commercial allows $13,000 for production. Super Bowl commercial cost $7,000. Super Bowl commercial allows $8,000 for production. Companies obviously WANT to make super bowl commercials of the highest quality, but they can't afford it.

The truth of the matter is more teens use these social networking sites than adults themselves, and if teachers were able to help the students, teach them how to use the sites in appropriate and safe ways, it'll make a difference. A lot of people miss-use social networking sites in bad ways, either discrimination, or degrading, so if teachers were able to teach and protect their students from these things by teaching it to them and adding it in the curriculum, they could change how teens use the internet in a positive way. Also i feel that, teenagers would like to learn more about social sites, and they would like to know how to use it the right way, so if they were taught at school, this would be a positive thing to do.

9,1,26256,"Arguments: Social networking sites are places where people 'share' or upload details of their personal life to the world wide web , in order to connect better with their friends or personal contacts. Under such circumstances social networking sites become ware houses for large amounts of pervading information into the life of its members which includes photographs, email and other contact details. This information is usually uploaded by members solely for the Eyes of their own contacts. Social Networking sites may find it difficult to maintain huge establishments merely through online applications and add generated revenue. They hence often find themselves compelled to cash in at other places. Multi-national co-operations and sometimes people with malafide intent are willing to pay money in exchange for personal contact details including personal preferences of ordinary people, these details are often used against the best interest of uncanny victims usually for marketing purposes, but sometimes for the more vicious credit card and other monetary frauds.

I will start with some facts I found whilst strolling the library. 200 University of Maryland students gave up online media as part of a new study in 2011. When asked how they felt during the brief disconnection, students' descriptions of frantic cravings for the technology, anxiety and jitters mirrored those typical of people going through withdrawal from drugs or alcohol. If people have become so addicted to social media, as the Maryland study suggests, it makes you wonder: Is social networking good or bad for us? Bad I say! We have always known that computer networks would destroy the world. We just thought they'd get super-intelligent first. Instead, we got social networks, which act as a stupidity X-ray. You suddenly see through the intelligent people your friends pretend to be to the LOL-ing Farmville players underneath. Some smart people decided to study these networks, and found that they're a big threat to society. At least the rise of those machines forced us to band together and do things. Debate closed.

You also said that people do get harmed form cyber bullying so your saying that everyone that gets bullied on the Internet goes how do I put it crazy? you are just putting it out there that you wouldn't be ashamed to say that someone has gone crazy to many people. harmful shouldn't really be the word used to define social networking sites but then again no word would really suit.

Not really, since anyone can edit their privacy settings. Facebook, like other social netwoking sites have upsides and downsides. Users may receive positive or negative feedback from others. But does that mean that we should totally ban them to teens? Again, no. I stated that FB can be used for educational purposes, my opponent refuting that statement by saying we have other references like the library is irrelevant. My opponent believes that FB made people more physically distant and gives people a false sense on getting better socially and makes people more closed minded.

9,17,37325,"This image of the Internet drawing people being closer together is simply an illusion. Sitting in front of computers rather than getting out in the world in fact isolates people from one another. Some academics argue that narcissism is the glue that keeps social networks together.[1] If people didn’t believe that their views were important and needed to be heard, then social networks would be unable to function. Social networks encourage people to express what they are doing rather than reading what others have to say. If people want to feel integrated into their communities, they should get out and about and do something active for it. Complaining about things online will not result in direct action solving the problem. Although it is true that people all over the world are now theoretically able to communicate with one another more easily, that is not how the Internet is actually used most of the time. Many Internet users either read digitized versions of traditional information sources, and when they are on social networking sites, they engage most often with real-life friends, with whom they could easily spend face-to-face time. Language is the other major barrier to worldwide integration. While there are translation tools online, most people online will stick to communicating in their native language, and this is particularly true of English speakers. The idea that the Internet is bringing new people together is on the whole a myth.

Victims of cyber bullying have even led victims to commit suicide in extreme cases[1][2]. Given that both physical[3] and psychological[4] damage have occurred through the use of social networking sites, such sites represent a danger to society as a whole. They have become a medium through which others express prejudice, including racism, towards groups and towards individuals[5]. Similarly, if a particularly country has a clear religious or cultural majority, it is fair to censor those sites which seek to undermine these principles and can be damaging to a large portion of the population. If we fail to take the measures required to remove these sites, which would be achieved through censorship, the government essentially fails to act on its principles by allowing such sites to exist.

Even if it weren’t for these social networks, those kids would likely still be getting 20% worse grades than other students, as they would just find other activities to replace it with. There will be no change in their mentality, perception of learning or process of decision making. If the student is using Facebook at least there is a chance they are using it productively, for example, by participating in a Facebook group created by a professor for students of a particular class, then the social network may have a positive influence. Moreover, Facebook makes students feel socially connected, with a greater sense of community. This can be beneficial in boosting students’ self-esteem.

Economics 101 would support that it is true in most if not all cases. Your statement ""raising the federal minimum wage may work to incentivize people who have previously relied on welfare to seek employment. "" seems more an indictment of welfare than a cogent argument for raising minimum wage. Here is another opinion (with a citation) From : ""Beginning in 2008, the United States economy entered a recession. Yet, at a time when many companies found it necessary to cut labor costs, the minimum wage increased. Faced with the limited choices of ( remaining in business) or laying off workers, the minimum wage workers were the ones to suffer by being laid off, according to Forbes.com. In 2004, three states that had higher minimum wage laws than were required---Alaska, Washington and Oregon---were among the five states with the highest unemployment, according to an Economic Policy Institute article by Jeff Chapman. "" To clarify, I would support keeping the minimum where it is, but making it beneficial for companies to give ""merit' or ""service"" increases. In other words, keep minimum wage as a STARTING wage, but give increases based on performance. This would be much better than a blanket raising of the wage for workers, some of whom are more of a liability than an asset. On a personal note, I once worked for a Fortune 500 corporation that paid minimum wage plus commission on sales. Those that sold did well. Those that did not produce usually left for another job.

Based on position statements on the Marco Rubio website, Rubio and other conservative Republicans indicate that increasing minimum wage through federal law would be seriously detrimental to small businesses across the country who would not be able to sustain the increase - and therefore risk going out of business. If that happens, unemployment would soar and the very people who were meant to benefit from the minimum wage increase would find themselves in a much worse financial situation, as a result. The logic that increasing the take home income of Americans will put money right back into the economy is fundamentally flawed based on the fact that it takes significant amounts of time for that money to trickle back up to the businesses that are supposedly sustaining the growth through payroll. Instead, I would argue that Marco Rubio's top-down approach - in which tax cuts for businesses, along with smarter economic policies, would help to create jobs that pay more.

What my opponent has failed to realize is that a simple increase of one dollar causes an increase of about 1.327 million dollars (per hour) for the US as a whole. Now let's be realistic. The US has a debt nearly the size of its GDP. The US is using basically stealing money from its citizens as it uses money from social security already piled up.

Instead of using whatever insufficient, excess money that the US has on increasing minimum wage, why not better the public infrastructure? When increasing public infrastructure, it allows individuals to have better access to education (for example schools and libraries), ultimately increasing the capability of citizens in the US. Obviously, once public infrastructure is bettered and mean tested welfare programs are back and running, we cannot allow for there to be any leeway for the increasing of minimum wage. Maybe, when the US gets it debt substantially lower than its GDP, then there may be a chance for minimum wage to be increased.

Furthermore, the minimum wage was invented to protect workers from corporate greed.

1,4,33824,"Even right here on Debate.org, the vast majority of people side with Ben Carson in believing that raising the minimum wage would increase unemployment. (See Beyond that, raising minimum wage across the board (such as the federal mandate proposed by Sanders) would inevitably result in businesses raising goods and services prices to account for the additional money they are spending in payroll which would not only negate any benefit, (maybe people make more, but if they have to spend more - it's a wash) but would also put even more financial strain on middle-class Americans who were meant to benefit from the wage hike in the first place. As businesses start looking to cut costs (to make up for higher wages), it's very likely that benefits (such as paid time off, employee reimbursement, tuition assistance, and other perks) would be drastically reduced or cut. Employees would then have to pay for these expenses out of their own pockets, further reducing their effective take-home pay. Raising the federal minimum wage is not an effective or sustainable way to accomplish the goals that Sanders is fighting for. Although it seems like a federally mandated minimum wage of $15 per hour would improve the financial situation of millions of Americans, it would actually bring about serious negative consequences for businesses, middle-class American families, and our economy as a whole.",-0.4466542626979497,True,-0.17562672878561345,1.1913116513890334,0.4070390699586256,226,False,0.5568951798589089

1,2,2675,"Contention- Having a minimum wage causes unemployment and/or outsourcing. When a government institutes a minimum wage, it is necessarily going to overvalue some workers. Let's say the federally mandated minimum wage is $4.00 per hour. As long as not every single employee in said government's jurisdiction is worth more(More, not the same because an employee who is paid the exact same wage that they make their employer defeats the purpose of hiring to a lesser degree of losing the employer money.) than $4.00 per hour, the minimum wage law will create unneeded unemployment. Some workers are simply not as valuable as the minimum wage would dictate and thus implementation of a minimum wage gives employers an incentive not to hire as many employees so as to not lose money. Besides unemployment, a minimum wage can also give business' incentive to outsource jobs to workers in countries where there is either not a minimum wage or the minimum wage is lower. The reasoning is the same. When workers are valued by either the market or the employer at a lower value than the mandated minimum wage, it creates a disincentive to employ in that area. The more cost-effective option other than simply not hiring as many employees is to hire employees from somewhere else. To force employers into over valuing their employees simply means that less people living in the territory in which the mandate takes place will be employed.

Before 2007, minimum wage was $5 an hour. This was more reasonable and teenage unemployment was decreasing. Then during 2007, the minimum wage was raised to $6.

Marriage is not universally an improvement, but it generally is. Because of this, it stands to reason that legalized gay marriage will ultimately prove beneficial for gay individuals. This, in turn, will be better for gay couples, the families of gays, and communities where gays live. Contention 2: Marriage Opponents of gay marriage argue that it would undermine the institution of marriage, but it's hard to see how more marriages would be bad for marriage. If anything harms marriage, it is bad marriages where people don't take marriage seriously - and that's already too common with heterosexuals. If gay couples in committed relationships are able to formalize their unions as marriages, that can only serve to improve marriage overall by providing more positive role models.

As agreed, I will not present rebuttals of his R2 arguments in this round, but will only build my affirmative case. Burden of Proof In this debate, my BoP is simply to prove that one minimum wage law enacted by the federal government is either financially strong, secure, or reliable. Con must prove that any minimum wage law enacted by the federal government is neither financially strong, secure, nor reliable. I am not obligated to defend any raise in the minimum wage, in fact I can advocate for a lower minimum wage and still uphold my burden of proof, which is to justify the existence of a minimum wage that is financially sound. Pro Case Unlike Con’s long and heavily sourced case, mine is extremely simple because the economic rationale behind the existence of the minimum wage is basically common sense. As inflation rises, the cost of living will rise, but wages will not necessarily rise. This translates to a less economic activity because as workers make less money compared to how much it costs them to live, they will be less likely to spend money. Something that works against economic activity declining is certainly a sound economic policy. Thus, it is necessary for the level of wages to be adjusted every so often in order to maintain economic growth. That’s it. I hope the audience will appreciate my keeping this simple argument short and simple rather than overstating my case, and will not hold this fact against me.

Due to the fact that the more their workers make, the more they have to downsize so they don't have to close the doors. Yes. An employee can be taking advantage of their work by only working say, an hour, and make say, $20 (Which for now, we'll assume is more than our current minimum wage). Since they don't deserve it, they'll be discharged, either temporarily or permanently, because of the suspicion of taking advantage of work. So yes, indeed, there must be a minimum wage. Expecially the fact that like said, an employee can work for months and only earn a dollar because, it belongs to the owner. The government doesn't really have any business in that. However, now, out of curiosity: Is this even supposed to be a rebuttal? Argument #2: Although I do support raising the minimum wage limit, I disagree on drastic increases. It just can't be done without whiplashes in the corporate world and in the working sector. My 2nd argument wasn't supporting increase in minimum wage.

In a perfect society on a perfect planet raising the minimum wage to decrease poverty levels is a stellar idea, however since sadly since we live nor work in a perfect society raising the minimum wage has consequences that defeat the purpose of the initial raising of the minimum wage. One of these unfortunate consequences is called inflation. ( Today many lower and middle class Americans live under the hope that their minimum wages will continue to rise, they believe that a bigger salary will lead to more purchasing power, which allow them to continue a safe, average life and maybe once in a while that they will be able to treat themselves. Wether this treat be a new car, a Caribbean cruise, or a more affordable education for their children. However sadly, since macroeconomics is not taught in public schools, most of these people do not understand the effects of inflation on the economy. Due to inflation raising the minimum wage is a useless weapon in combating poverty because the economy will simply boost their prices in response to a raise of the federal minimum wage. Below is a link to a list which contains a few items whose prices have been inflated over time in The United States. ( In conclusion, raising the minimum wage does practical nothing as inflation is always on guard, waiting to pounce as soon as the government officials put pen to paper.",-4.0,False,-4.0,-4.0,-4.0,277,True,-4.0

Animal tests are the experiment that the humans do for such medical development and scientific development. Animals are comfortable, fest, and easy for the humans to do experiments since they have similar body structure like the humans. For example, chimpanzees share 99%of their DNA with the humans, and mice are 98% genetically similar to the humans. That may save the time of the experiment. Animal tests may give much help to the life time of the humans. Humans have life cycle, and these animal experiments may expand the humans' life cycles. It is because it deveops the medical curing system for the humans.Animal tests creates the products to be better and safe. Also, science became more and more important these days because of environmental problems and the development of technology. So, improving the science will be helpful.

Three nights and four improbable wins later, it was not the Yankees, but the Red Sox, who were representing the American League in the World Series.

Let's take a look at Rivera's other mishaps against Boston: In 2004, prior to the World Series, hours after a brawl broke up, he gave up a walk-off home run to Bill Mueller at Fenway. He blew his first two saves of the 2005 season against the BoSox, and posts a career 8.10 ERA against them. Papelbon cleary came off with the better '07 season, comparing his 30 saves to Jonathan's 37.

I am sure my opponent is familiar with the equation for GDP: C + I + G + (X-M) A federal surplus simply shows the government taxing more then it's spending. If we look at the 90's, we see the US trade deficit exploding. This, obviously, caused the trade deficit to subtract from the GDP, and the government, running the ""surplus"" kept sucking dollars out of the private sector when it needed them. What compensated? Private consumption. Notice how household savings collapsed during the Clinton years? Household debt also began to surge. Because when the federal government takes on a ""surplus"" private sector savings are directly affected. The private sector can't survive in negative territory, the private sector, unlike a currency issuer such as the us govt, can't continue to spend more then it brings in. I feel like adding something else to this: When the government is running a surplus, it's not issuing as many bonds. But various entities like treasury payouts and a safe place to park earned dollars. Isn't it funny that fannie and freddie insurance surged in the 90's? This is where debt started being sold like never before, due to a lack of bonds.

You where saying that only being able to use your feet makes soccer harder and more unique and I do agree, but hockey is similar. In hockey you can use your hands (but only to bat the puck out of the air) but we also have to control a smaller object far from our body with a stick. We have to be able to know where it is on our stick without even looking at it, and we are doing this while we are on skates. people generally do not realize the amount of coordination you need in hockey. Also the power, agility, and explosivness needed is unbelievable. My last point for my argument is that hockey is faster and more entertaining. Because hockey is being played on skates, it is very fast. Shifts are short so every player comes out fast and powerfull. The ice rink is way smaller than a soccer field. This creates more action near the net and way more shots on goal. The goalies are constantly making huge saves and making big plays. In soccer there are less shots and less action.

2,12,43496,"Liberty is one of the highest values human beings strive for. Liberty means that individuals ‘own’ themselves: individuals only decide for themselves what to do with their minds and bodies during their lifetime. Private property is an extension of this, because private property comes about by undertaking an activity with one’s own body or mind: when I pluck apples from a wild apple tree, they become my property through me using my own body to do the plucking. Similarly, free exchange is an extension of this, because it only comes about if both parties perceive the exchange to be beneficial to them: I will only sell the apples I plucked if I get more value in exchange than the value that continued possession of the apples gives me. Free markets are the only system of allocating goods and wealth in society that relies on these basic notions of liberty to operate. If someone becomes rich in a free market, then that came about through free exchange: this person has provided so many goods and services of value to other people, that they gave him or her great wealth in return.  Compare this to the government redistributing wealth: that would require the government appropriating part of someone’s income via taxes. That income is private property. Appropriating private property, not voluntary exchange, amounts to theft, which means that taxes are a form of theft and therefore a significant harm to individual liberty. Free markets don’t harm liberty like this, which is why they are morally superior. ",-0.7594352918379461,True,1.068573609987491,0.5740332642551116,1.2217594654141084,254,True,1.1005140915315916

Since the government needs revenue to function (if you don't want the government to function, that is an issue with government, not a tax itself), we come to the question of how should the government generate revenue? Since the wealthy have more income, they have more of an ability to cover the revenue demand, and the only way to accurately tax that, is to tax income (since income is the founding source of the majority of wealth).

To cut taxes we need to reduce government spending, this includes cutting major government expenditures such as welfare and warfare (defense spending). By cutting our spending we can reduce our taxes which will benefit the individual and the economy.

Even after its passage the income tax did not even effect most people until the 1950's and 1960's, up until that point only a certain percentage of Americans payed income tax (2).

Marriage always has been a covenant between man and woman. It is by nature that a marriage is to unify a man and a woman, not a woman and a woman or a man and a man. 2) Gay Marriage goes against nature. Marriage serves two purposes: to unify and to procreate. A man and a man cannot create another human. Only a man and a woman can do that. Let me give you an analogy: say I have a chair. A chair, defined in a dictionary, is something used to sit on. That is the chair's nature. Not to stand on or throw. Standing on the chair or throwing the chair defeats the chair's purpose. You see, if you do anything else other than sit on the chair, you have a risk of breaking the chair or harming yourself. In a way, this chair is marriage. A marriage by nature is man and woman. Anything other than that defeats its purpose and risks to damage the beauty of marriage. 3) Gay Marriage, even if right in society's eyes, are wrong morally. From a religious standpoint, it is morally wrong and against God's will to support gay marriage. This is not saying that being gay is wrong, in fact, it might a good thing.

What my opponent has failed to realize is that a simple increase of one dollar causes an increase of about 1.327 million dollars (per hour) for the US as a whole. Now let's be realistic. The US has a debt nearly the size of its GDP. The US is using basically stealing money from its citizens as it uses money from social security already piled up. Do you really and honestly think that we can afford increasing spending on minimum wage? Frankly, no. Even though it may be beneficial towards those working on minimum wage, as a whole, it would greatly impact the US. Furthermore, if so many people are working on minimum wage, the most effective way to better the income issue would be to increase the education of individuals, therefore increasing the amount of opportunities coming their way. Instead of using whatever insufficient, excess money that the US has on increasing minimum wage, why not better the public infrastructure? When increasing public infrastructure, it allows individuals to have better access to education (for example schools and libraries), ultimately increasing the capability of citizens in the US. Obviously, once public infrastructure is bettered and mean tested welfare programs are back and running, we cannot allow for there to be any leeway for the increasing of minimum wage. Maybe, when the US gets it debt substantially lower than its GDP, then there may be a chance for minimum wage to be increased.

We can't test on humans primarly because of the moral. But if we can't use humans, why can we use animals? My reasons for using animals on research and/or experiments are: Most of the animals are breed in laboratories specifically for testing (like flies). This doesn't affect a species population. In fact, the species used are really common and aren't endangered. Animals (specifically mice) can be breed for a special experiment. An animal life could help the human race to find a cure, understand how certain organs work or even make a progress in the genetics area.

Further to that, gay marriage encourages gay adoption, granting a home and a loving environment for an increasing number of orphaned or unwanted children worldwide. The evidence also suggests that gay parenting is ‘at least as favourable’ as those in heterosexual families, eroding fears that the adopted children will be worse with gay parents 2 .

11,11,3539,"There are several reasons why health care should not be considered a universal human right. The first issue is one of definition – how do we define the services that need to be rendered in order for them to qualify as adequate health care? Where do we draw the line? Emergency surgery, sure, but how about cosmetic surgery? The second is that all human rights have a clear addressee, an entity that needs to protect this right. But who is targeted here? The government? What if we opt for a private yet universal health coverage – is this any less moral? Let’s forget the institutions for a second, should this moral duty of health care fall solely on the doctors perhaps?[1] In essence, viewing health care as a right robs us of another, much more essential one – that of the right to one’s own life and one’s livelihood. If it is not considered a service to be rendered, than how could a doctor charge for it? She couldn’t! If it were a right, than each of us would own it, it would have to be inseparable from us.

The privatisation of health care promotes exclusive health care, and is failing to bridge the gap between accessible care for low-income groups and the elite. The model remains unaffordable for many, and therefore ineffective. Even where affordable options are available the quality of care deteriorates. Quality assurance, and affordable care, is needed. For example, taking the case of South Africa. Health care is provided through both public and private systems.

Prices need to be controlled and affordable options made available. Although formal employers have been involved in supporting access and coverage to health insurance schemes, to prevent a two-tier health system, a majority work within formal employment.

11,1,42405,"Hi! INTRO/EXPLANATION: Because of the sometimes astronomical cost of health care, the Affordable Care Act includes a new provision that makes many preventive services available patients. These services will not require co-pays or deductibles, and will apply to both self-inusured and fully insured plans. Among these preventative services are FDA-approved contraceptives for men and women, with some restrictions. This provision was included as a way to drive down costs, to reduce pressure on overburdened systems, and to remove cost barriers - ensuring that more women maintain access to preventative health care. [1] Only half of Americans have historically sought health care as a normal preventative measure, and this has driven up medical costs in the US exponentially. [1] Additionally, women's health care needs in particular can be difficult to meet, especially in relation to reproductive health, where the health of an infant may be necessarily included. [2] Hopefully, this debate will help to explain some of the reasons for including preventative health care and reproductive health care in particular, as part of any new health care reform laws.

Instead of having the government pay for everyone's health care people should buy their own insurance for catastrophic care and pay straight up for routine visits.

Instead of having gigantic and waste there would be incentives in place for competing health care organizations to stream line and be more efficient. Because they are bill patients and not the government doctors will be less likely to price gouge. Doctors who were trained in other countries would be able to practice because we would eliminate licensure and take away the special privileges of the doctor's cartels.

The scholars I interviewed for this essay were variously dismayed or appalled by this trend.

And cultural anthropologist Dr. Esther Newton (University of Michigan) called one study linking sexual orientation to biological traits ludicrous: ""Any anthropologist who has looked cross-culturally (knows) it""s impossible that that""s true, because sexuality is structured in such different ways in different cultures.""

In addition, national health care will only further increase our never-ending debt, driving us further and further down a road we are not prepared for.

11,8,3539,"With universal health care, people are able to seek preventive treatment. This means having tests and check-ups before they feel ill, so that conditions can be picked up in their early stages when they are easy to treat. For example in a recent study 70% of women with health insurance knew their cholesterol level, while only 50% of uninsured women did. In the end, people who do not get preventive health care will get treatment only when their disease is more advanced. As a result their care will cost more and the outcomes are likely to be much worse. Preventative care, made more accessible, can function the same way, reducing the costs further.[1] In addition, a single-payer system reduces the administrative costs. A different way of charging for the care, not by individual services but by outcomes, as proposed by Obama’s bill, also changes incentives from as many tests and procedures as possible to as many patients treated and healed as possible.[2] We thus see that not only does universal health coverage inherently decrease costs because of preventative care, much of the cost can be avoided if implemented wisely and incentivized properly.

11,7,13892,"My opponent brings up two important points. They support his argument rather well. However, their main flaw is that they are not backed up by anything. I suggest using a source (the Bible would be nice) to show where Jesus showed any inclination to support something like the health care bill. Now, I'll make two points: 1. Jesus wasn't really into political coercion. As God, he would support the free will of the people. Note that different denominations have different opinions of free will, but it is false to say that all of Christianity would be against the exercise of free will. 2. The bill does not help the poor at all. The bill requires health insurance companies to accept people with pre-existing conditions indiscriminately [1]. This means that they must raise premiums for everybody to be able to afford to insure those who will cost more to care for. This rise in premiums will turn the healthy people away from buying health care, resulting in adverse impact [2], driving health care prices higher and higher. When a healthy person suddenly becomes ill, he can apply for health insurance anyway, calling his sudden disease a pre-existing condition. The company would be forced to accept him and pay for for his health care. This would make profits for health insurance companies practically impossible in the long run.

11,14,3539,"One of the countries lauded for its universal health care is France. So what has the introduction of universal coverage brought the French? Costs and waiting lists. France’s system of single-payer health coverage goes like this: the taxpayers fund a state insurer called Assurance Maladie, so that even patients who cannot afford treatment can get it. Now although, at face value, France spends less on healthcare and achieves better public health metrics (such as infant mortality), it has a big problem. The state insurer has been deep in debt since 1989, which has now reached 15 billion euros.[1] Another major problem with universal health care efficiency is waiting lists. In 2006 in Britain it was reported that almost a million Britons were waiting for admission to hospitals for procedures. In Sweden the lists for heart surgery are 25 weeks long and hip replacements take a year. Very telling is a ruling by the Canadian Supreme Court, another champion of universal health care: “access to a waiting list is not access to health care”.[2] Universal health coverage does sound nice in theory, but the dual cancers of costs and waiting lists make it a subpar option when looking for a solution to offer Americans efficient, affordable and accessible health care.

There are currently 40 million uninsured in America let's assume every single one of them decide to get health care the average American according to the average American family pays $414 a month now let's do the math that is an estimated $16,560,000,000 [ sixteen billion five hundred sixty million ] per month for the health care industry and let's accumulate your estimated loss of 3.5 billion that'd be 13060000000 { thirteen billion sixty million} Still a huge increase of net for insurance company who's dancing their way to the bank.

As an aside, the same argument – lowered costs – could be made for simply improving the existing tactics of preventative medicine without the need to invest into universal coverage. Returning to this proposition though, while it might be realistic to expect some reduction in costs from improved prevention, those would very unlikely ever amount to a significant amount – and certainly not an amount that would make introducing universal health coverage a feasible strategy.[1] Universal health care will cause people to use the health care system more.

Doe that undocumented children have the same right to attend public primary and secondary schools as U.S. citizens. About 1.6 million undocumented immigrants are children and allowing them education is allowing them a future in life. Not doing so, however, restricts the success which they may have otherwise received as a result of education. Also, preventing immigrants from gaining basic health benefits is actually a technique that will only increase health care spending and add to a sicker U.S. population. Lawmakers have authorized a special Medicaid fund that mostly goes towards providing emergency treatments for undocumented immigrants. The program costs about $2 billion per year, and most of that money is used on delivering babies for pregnant, undocumented women. However, since the $2 billion provided for undocumented immigrants is only set aside for pregnancies, there is still a large gap in the services provided for these people. The lack of access to care services is a problem given that low-income undocumented immigrants tend to have specialized and chronic health care needs such as diabetes and obesity.

Without insurance everyone ends up paying. Uninsured people more often than not, cannot afford to pay their medical bills. These unpaid bills end up being compensated by the government (taxes), or by hospital charging insurances more to make up for the deficit. When people are uninsured, more often than not they wait until 11th hour, where treatment is both crucial and costly. Had they been insured, preventative care would have saved everyone the cost they can no longer afford. The way Obamacare works is that everyone pays based on income. The healthy can afford insurance for when they need it, and this pays for the cost of the unhealthy who are also paying. While individual costs may be irksome on an individual basis, overall we are saving money on health care costs since hospitals are getting reimbursed and patients are getting more preventative care than they were before.",1.1172508830020322,True,-0.24617720899331105,1.391363020559596,0.6102921087872473,178,False,0.6925587229045251

This money is represented by a medical loss ratio, a number that usually ranges from 75 percent for the most cost-effective and efficient plans to more than 100 percent for the losing plan (Washington Post). Business costs associated with the services offered are typically around 15% of their revenues.

Also, some people may feel restricted and uncomfortable in these outfits that they are forced into. Everyone has a different body shape and type. Why should we force everyone to look and dress the same? Some people also say that clothes can distract students from learning, but if they are uncomfortable in the uniforms, they will not learn. We should allow student to dress in clothes that they are comfortable in. Lastly, I believe that it can draw away from school spirit.

This might not be directly linked to what they're wearing, but having a uniform can be a safety net for many students who might otherwise suffer from bullying.

Ok, even if people don't wear the same quality uniform, then this might result for the principal to setup some consequences like detention, seeing the student back home, or even expelling the student ( which I believe nobody wants this to happen). 2. How can wearing uniform increase distractions when everyone is wearing the same outfit? No one will be distracted because students know that they are wearing the same outfit as everyone else, so why bother looking at others uniforms when you have the same one!!!! 3. And the concern that how does it increase self confidence, there is a simple answer to it. In a non-uniform school when middle and lower class children wear something and the rich children wear famous, expensive clothing, the middle and lower class children feel excluded, negative things about themselves, and the fact that they can't afford these type of expensive clothing. That is the main reason why bullying happens in public schools. But if everyone wears uniforms, then the rich children will wear the same uniform as others wear. And if everyone wears the same uniform, children will have self confidence that they will not be targeted as a victim of bullying of any other bad activity.

According to CIA world factbook 2012, 100 million animals are burned, crippled, and killed in labs every year. Why would that be right to continue doing? Also, according to the same source several cosmetic tests commonly performed on mice, rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs include: skin and eye irritation tests where chemicals are rubbed on shaved skin or dripped into the eyes without any pain relief. repeated force-feeding studies that last weeks or months, to look for signs of general illness or specific health hazards. widely condemned ""lethal dose"" tests, where animals are forced to swallow large amounts of a test chemical to determine what dose causes death. So now that we know the destruction of Animal testing, let us explain why it would not effect our environment. First, a great many companies are advertising ""no animal testing."" This seems to be something that is growing larger and larger due to the drive to save animal's lives. In addition, scientists are creating molecular compound breakdown devices that can predict the result of a drug without testing it on a living thing. This is done by examining the structure of a molecule and the effect it has on the cosmos. This technology will continue to increase and animal testing will become less necessary. So the plan I am proposing is this: By one years time, animal testing will become illegal to where no IPA drugs or medicines are tested on animals. One years time will be plenty of time to break our reliability on animal testing. The murdering of animals is something that must be stopped, which is why it should be banned.

In a poll, 53 per cent of the respondents said the launch of social networking sites had changed their behaviour - and of those, 51 per cent said the impact had been negative.(2 ) One study also backs this statistics up by finding that the more the participants used the site, the more their life satisfaction levels declined.(3) In conclusion, daily use of social networks has a negative effect on the health of all children and teenagers by making them more prone to anxiety, depression, and other psychological disorders.(4) (1) “Facebook is bad for you”, The Economist, Aug 17th 2013 http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21583593-using-social-network-seems-make-people-more-miserable-get-life (2)  Laura Donnelly “Facebook and Twitter feed anxiety, study finds” The Telegraph,  08 Jul 2012 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/9383609/Facebook-and-Twitter-feed-anxiety-study-finds.html (3) “Facebook use 'makes people feel worse about themselves' “, BBC News, 15 August 2013 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23709009 (4) Larry Rose ”Social Networking’s Good and Bad Impacts on Kids“ American Psychological Association August 6, 2011 http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2011/08/social-kids.aspx",-0.13387323355795333,True,0.1618138021713807,0.5127760206578758,1.324567283202216,268,True,0.7751110684633672

Also, you make the point of whatever you are wearing takes the focus off education, but rather, I believe it can enhance it. According to research done on the subject, there is no effect on academics, substance abuse, or absent days, when students are required to wear a uniform. Students tire easily of repetition, and it is necessary to create diversity in their schooling in order to keep them interested and to be ready to learn. For your next point, students will get bullied regardless of what they wear. Bullying can happen even in uniform based schools. For example, uniforms can often cost a substantial amount of money, and if the parents don't have the income to provide the same quality of uniform as everyone else, they may get bullied. Bullying will happen regardless of what they wear, and very rarely is bullying focused solely on clothing.

How we express ourselves through our clothing helps us define ourselves. Wearing the same clothes every single day takes huge toll on our transition into adulthood. Wearing a uniform also is a big factor in youth depression. Imaging being a teen girl, staring into the school bathroom mirrors with tears in her eyes because a couple of the ""popular girls"" were just making fun of her. Uniforms main purpose is to make everyone look homogeneous (the same) but in fact they do the exact opposite. When everyones wearing the same thing you would image they all look the same. Thats totally wrong. Everyone has different body types, weights and heights. After a recent study I have discovered that almost every girl that wears a school uniform is often embarrassed to go to school wearing those clothes. Also most people think that uniforms try to desexualize youth, It does the exact the opposite. When those students come home they feel ugly.

At my new school, we have no uniform policy, yet, it is praised as one of the top 5 schools in the State of Kentucky. You are also wrong when you say, ""When schools have uniforms kids focus more on they're studies not on they're clothes or how they look."" Once again, I use MCS as my evidence. Every single day, girls would come into class and put on their makeup and guys would comb their hair with their hair picks, in total disregard for what the policy states. At my new school, everyone does their work and they don't really care about what other people are wearing. Kids are not friendlier when there is a uniform policy in place. In fact, students are more hostile. In the minds of students, they are being forced wear something that they do not want to.

By having a large circle of friends to talk to and share interests, the child gains trust, self-esteem and self-confidence. If you have people to talk to when you have a problem, it is much easier to overcome any problems. Facebook and social networks in general help teenagers on multiple levels to maintain and expand their circle of friends. Firstly, it lets you remain in touch with friends even if you are very far apart. As we live in an increasingly globalized world, friend circles tend to be broken up very easily. As a result, individuals need to be able to keep in touch in spite of the physical distance. Facebook enables them to do that. (1) Secondly, by allowing people with shared opinions, hobbies or interests to gather, social networks allow users to expand their circle of friends, something that is more applicable the bigger the social network. Thirdly, it allows young people to spend more time with the friends and people they already know through chat conversations, shared photos or status updates. As a result, people who are engaged on these social networks have more self esteem, more confidence in them, feel more appreciated and tend to be happier in general due to their wide circle of friends.

In addition, standardized tests do not reflect other areas of growth such as emotional growth. In addition, if the government is requiring this testing, they should be funding schools so that they have the resources needed to administer the tests.

Coming from a state where the HSPA is not given (nor required), I cannot say that I am arguing against the HSPA directly. However, with the knowledge of other standardized testing (even going so far as to include the SAT and ACT), I will argue that these tests do offer a measurement of ability. Of course, one cannot define oneself off of one score, but these tests are not designed for students to fail. Often times, even with those that have difficulty testing, many are able to achieve passing grades, or the comparative college-readiness levels. Concerning the HSPA testing, with scores ranging from 100 to 300, and a passing grade of 200, there is a high chance that many students will be able to achieve a passing level. Whether these individuals acquire a grade they are pleased with is a separate question, but when looking at the number of individuals able to pass, these numbers should be higher. Yes, I will acknowledge that testing does not come easily to all individuals, and that even the smartest of people will not test to the same ability that they show in the classroom.

But, while No Child Left Behind is inequatable, attempts to equalize finances amongst different schools would also be a disaster for very much the same reason things are so uneven today. To explore this more deeply, let us look at how States typically fund schools. In most states, some portion of tax revenue goes to funding education, and in most states, whether that piece of the financial pie is large or small, it IS actually disbursed equally between schools in different areas. While this is well-intentioned to level the playing field between schools, it's folly lies in different levels of wealth in the areas recieving money. We'll get into more detail on this as the debate progresses, but to keep it short for now, it is my contention that funding schools UNEQUALLY to favor and compensate schools in poor-er neighborhoods will have better results for education than funding rich schools and poor schools equally.

Agreeing what must be taught is difficult enough in a local setting; nationally such agreement is probably not achievable. Which historic figures should all students learn about? What parts of history are most important? Should creationism be taught in science or religious education? Maribeth Wilkerson, a graduate student of education, argues 'public schools are serving a particular community, so for that community to not have a say in what's taught and how doesn't seem right'1. Also, and partly as a result, good standards are difficult to come up with. Standards are either too vague so that the test-makers and teachers do not know what material to focus on, or they are too detailed so that teachers and students are swamped by the large number of subjects that must be covered. For instance, in the United States, standards are expected to improve with time, leading to fears that even if schools and students improve, they will not do so quick enough to meet national expectations2.

It deals mostly with learning how to take the test: time management, multiple choice strategy, and quick reading comprehension.

There are also full practice tests offered on the SAT website for anyone with an internet connection [2]. After a 30-second search on YouTube, I found an entire channel devoted to math SAT prep with videos that give an entire virtual course on it [3]. All it takes to prepare for standardized tests is commitment and hard work, whether someone is rich and privileged or not. Even a rich student who goes to the most expensive tutor available still has to take the time to absorb the information and practice to improve their score. I would argue that the test is not only, like you said, ""a measure of pure intellectual strength;"" in addition, it is a measure of how hard the student is willing to work in order to achieve.

Additionally, teachers may treat their students differently depending on their intellectual ability or their behaviour.

Even if this succeeds, it is still very difficult to define what a 'good performance' is, because a student's individual performance is determined by many other factors than the teacher and also because an individual student's 'performance' is actually a complex set of attitudes, skills and abilities which are in and of themselves hard to operationalize in a standard test.

Yes, there is more of a push for results on standardized tests, but the pressure is being felt by the teaching staff, not the students. In fact, our school has set up programs over the last year to try to motivate students to take these tests more seriously. Even many high school seniors who are trying to get into college do not stress over taking tests like the ACT. I have seen very few cases where students are ""stressing out"" over a standardized test.

Corporal punishment is when a teacher punishes a student physically for a mistake, and it needs to be brought back to schools. It is true that it has been misused in the past, but with new rules, corporal punishment would be a new and healthy part of a student's life. In this case, the ruler shall not be used, or any other tool used to strike the student, including the hand of a teacher. Instead, the punishment will be carried out in the form of running. Depending on the severity of the student's mistake and his/her physical status, the student will be required to run a certain distance. By doing this, it will not only ensure the student will not be abused by a teacher, and it is also good physical excersize. According to running will help build strong bones, strengthen muscles, improve cardiovascular fitness. burn plenty of kilojoules. and help maintain a healthy weight. This way, not only is the student punished, it also helps maintain a student's good health. This form of punishment will also avoid missing classtime, which is a problem caused by detention or suspension. The running will be done before or after school, therefore no classtime will be missed, allowing the student to learn everything he/she is supposed to learn. It also costs no money to use this form of punishment. It is efficent both time and money wise. Therefore, corporal punishment should be brought back to schools in the form of running.",0.1789077955820434,True,1.3623145482535706,1.0435743589715794,0.3255836091668985,274,True,1.055115861500832
4,24,42549,"Corporal punishment offers any easy way out for teachers. Rather than trying to engage with disruptive children in order to find out the cause of their misbehavior, they can send them on to be physically punished so that hopefully they will not speak up as much in class. This serves only to mask the underlying problem in many instances. Often the students who act out most in class suffer from domestic abuse, or are from unstable households 1. These students are the most vulnerable in the classroom, and corporal punishment does nothing to help them, but rather serves only to compound the problem further. Teachers will often take the easy solution, so that when given the option of passing troubled students on for more stringent discipline, they let down in the greatest need of help. This is played out in the United States, where in states that allow corporal punishment test scores tend to be lower. 36% of states that allow corporal punishment have a state composite score average above the national mean; compared to 89% of those where it is banned scoring above the mean.2 This has been attributed to lack of attempted engagement by teachers with students, who instead choose the violent, confrontational salve of corporal punishment over more constructive engagement. Clearly, corporal punishment does nothing but encourage teachers to take the path that is easy for them at the expense of their students' wellbeing. 1 Newsweek.

I will be arguing in the negative, and my opponent will argue as a proponent of the reintroduction of corporal punishment into the school system.

4,4,36962,"NOTE: You didn't say USA only so I shall use statistics and facts from aroudn the globe (mainly UK). Now onto the main debate. In a survey completed by the Times Educational supplement [1], 6000 teachers were questioned. One in five believed that class room behaviour had deteriorated since the abolition of corporal punishment and they believed the education system would improve with the re-introduction of corporal punishment. We should adhere to the teachers requests. It is inevitable that bad classroom behaviour will filter into life outside school. You only have to look at the crime statistics to see that crime has increased dramatically since the abolition of corporal punishment. Between 1981, when corporal punishment was legal and in 1997, after the abolition of corporal punishment, there was a 67% increase in crime [2]. Children’s behaviour has been adversely affected by the rights culture we have in Britain. A teacher cannot threaten a detention, something they are allowed to do, without the retort of “but you can't take away my freedom”, “you have no right” or “I have rights”. In fact children are acutely aware of how much power they have over the teachers by way of laws and rights, and they use every opportunity to remind the teachers of that fact. If we re-introduced corporal punishment this back chat would cease and the power would be retained by the teachers. Detention is not going to be taken seriously by anyone. What does detention do other than waste your time? If you have ADHD or a creative mind you'll have a blast, effectively learning nothing to *correct* your behavior. If this is the only effective authority a teacher has for an out of control student then that teacher is and probably knows his/her authority is rather pitiful.

Columbine and Virginia Tech are only two among multiple other shooting rampages that took place on school campuses. While police responded as quickly as they could, they were unable to stop the shooter(s) before they could kill dozens of students and teachers. Had there been a student or teacher on the school's grounds however, there is a very real possibility that the shooter(s) would have been stopped in the very early stages of their tirade. 2) Utah was the first (and I believe only so far) state to universally allow citizens with concealed carry permits to carry while on college campuses. Thusfar they have had no major incidents that have resulted from CHL holders on college campuses. Other individual college campuses around the U.S. (Ex: Colorado State University) allow concealed carry and have similarly suffered no major incidents from CHL carriers. 3) The only people who would be allowed to carry concealed while on college campuses would be (based on proposed states' legislation) the same people who could normally own and carry a gun everywhere else. To conclude my argument this round, adding concealed carry to college campuses has yet to cause a problem, and therefore, the state has no right to not allow people who already carry concealed elsewhere to carry on campus.",1.1172508830020322,True,1.2942760644976992,1.1966556338166487,0.3607855580777995,241,True,1.1008711940104372

4,20,42549,"Being hit, even in a controlled environment, is a jarring experience, particularly for young children. Even if it were effective in reducing anti-social and disruptive behavior, the negative effects of corporal punishment outweigh the benefit1. Physically being struck is painful and unsettling. Bruises and welts represent painful reminders of punishments that a student might well feel to be unjust. The lasting pain thus makes corporal punishment a much more serious cause of resentment than do less physically taxing punishments as detentions. Furthermore, the psychological harms of such punishment can be long lasting, creating in some children resentment toward authority generally. Worse, it can create resentment and negative psychic impressions of school, and thus education generally, further weakening the ability of the school and the teacher to impart knowledge .1 American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on School Health. 1984.

4,2,14005,"Ok, so sorry for the delay, I had school exams and stuff but their almost over. First, some definitons and background info: Corporal Punishment is the infliction of physical pain as a consequence of a criminal offence. By Singaporean law, Corporal Punishment can only be sentenced to a male offender between the ages of 18 and 50 who has been certified to be in a fit state of health by a medical officer. Juveniles may also be sentenced to Corporal Punishment, but to no more than 10 strokes. Offenders below the age of 16 can only be sentenced by the High Court and State Courts. Anyway, Corporal punishment IS an effective crime deterrent. The fundamental basis of deterrence from anything is: If you do this, bad things will happen to you. Since imprisonment in itself isn't a good deterrent and the effects of a criminal record on your future career options is intangible, Corporal Punishment represents a direct incentive to refrain from crime due to the physical pain caused. The medical effects can be viewed here: I would also like to state that caning is not taken likely by the judicial system in Singapore. Singaporean law allows caning to be ordered for over 35 offences, including hostage-taking/kidnapping, robbery, gang robbery with murder, drug abuse, vandalism, extortion, rioting, sexual abuse, and unlawful possession of weapons. Caning is also a mandatory punishment for certain offences such as rape, drug trafficking, illegal money-lending, and for visiting foreigners who overstay their visa by more than 90 days (a measure designed to deter illegal immigrant workers).

4,3,3464,"In my opinion, corporal punishment is brutal and too severe a disciplinary action. Corporal punishment can often be very traumatic to the person it is inflicted upon. So much so that a child subjected to corporal punishment more often than not grows up to abuse physically not only his own family but other acquaintances as well. Thankfully, this practice has been banned in several nations and is a punishable offence in a few others. There are more humane ways of admonishing a child. Take for example grounding him or her. This leaves space for the juvenile to ruminate over his or her bad behaviour and even offers a chance for reformation. However, if a child is beaten up in order to drill in some moral lesson, there is a high chance the innocent will fall back on its lesson and commit a similar offence, leading to a vicious cycle. In summary, corporal punishment is detrimental to a child's overall growth and can impair his/her self-esteem and cause lasting damage.",-0.13387323355795333,True,0.9906988614009165,-0.1303414728624452,0.2308762679538822,169,False,0.4236948315183014

If a student knows they will only be lectured, they will be less likely to stop behaving that way than if they were lectured and mildly punished physically.

A recent Dr. Phil show explained the effects of corporal punishment perfectly. Some children respond to it but others respond negatively to it. If a child really responds negatively to it, then you have a worse problem than you started with. Mental illness is much more prevalent today than it was in the 1950s/1960s. If a student is acting out due to mental illness and they are punished for it, that will make the mental illness worse. If we have a student that is about to become a school shooter, a few smacks is not going to stop them. It would just make them more angry and aggressive, if anything. Also, culture had become more ""me centered"". People are much more self-centered and selfish now than in the 1950s/1960s.

There is nothing wrong with students having a bit of fear with regard to teachers, just as it is right to have a healthy fear of the state, insofar as transgressions of the law will be met by serious repercussions. Coddling children and limiting the level of punishments that can be leveled against them too strictly does not prepare them for the real world in which infractions of the law have serious consequences.

If you are hitting a child out of anger you are not disciplining them. Children do not learn from things like time outs, because there is nothing to associate to with misbehavior.

The death penalty is costly When I say costly, I mean that according to NBC it costs about 1.7 million dollars to execute someone. New Jersey got rid of the death penalty because it costed 4 million dollars per inmate and they hadn't executed anyone since 1963. Plus, inmates staring into the face of the death penalty are entitled to two lawyers which could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars alone. 2. What if they're innocent The fact that the risk of ending the life of an innocent person should not be permitted, Killing an innocent person is morally reprehensible, so why should our justice system allow that possibility to exist? By eliminating the death penalty we eliminate any chance of this happening. 3.

14,7,20935,"To start off, I will discuss the history of the death penalty. The first established death penalty laws date as far back as the Eighteenth Century B.C. in the code of King Hammaurabi of Babylon, which codified the death penalty for 25 different crimes. Death sentences were carried out by such means as crucifixion, boiling, beheading, burning alive, and impalement, etc. In the 10th century A.D., hanging became the peculiar method of execution in Britain. In the following century, William the Conqueror would not allow persons to be hanged or otherwise executed for any crime, except in times of war. This trend would not last, for in the Sixteenth Century, under the reign of Henry VIII, as many as 72,000 people are estimated to have been executed. Britain influenced America's use of the death penalty more than any other country. The first recorded execution in the new colonies was that of Captain George Kendall in the Jamestown colony of Virginia in 1608. Kendall was executed for being a spy for Spain. Today, the death penalty continues to be an issue of controversy, but the number of people that are for the death penalty continues to grow. An example of this is the law that passed in 1994. As part of an omnibus crime bill, the federal death penalty was expanded to some 60 different offenses. Among the federal crimes for which people in any state or territory of the U.S. can receive a death sentence are murder of certain government officials, kidnapping resulting in death, murder for hire, fatal drive-by shootings, sexual abuse crimes resulting in death, car jacking resulting in death, and certain crimes not resulting in death, including the running of a large-scale drug enterprise.

The results are dramatic, particularly for a state outside of the deep south, a region where racial disparities in the criminal justice system have a long history.

I must ask, how would you feel if you were on death row for a crime you didn't commit? What about a family member?

14,12,12897,"There are many reasons to doubt the deterrent effect of the death penalty. For one thing, many criminals may actually find the prospect of the death penalty less daunting (and thus, less effective as a deterrent) than spending the rest of their lives suffering in jail. Death by execution is generally fairly quick, while a lifetime in prison can be seen as a much more intensive punishment. Moreover, even if criminals preferred life in prison to the death penalty, it's not clear that a harsher punishment would effectively deter murders. Heinous crimes often occur in the heat of the moment, with little consideration for their legal repercussions1. Further, for a deterrent to be effective, it would have to be immediate and certain. This is not the case with the death penalty cases, which often involve prolonged appeals and sometimes end in acquittals2. Finally, the empirical evidence regarding the deterrence effect of the death penalty is at best mixed. Many of the studies that purport to show the deterrence effect are flawed, because the impact of capital punishment cannot be disentangled from other factors such as broader social trends, economic factors and demographic changes in a region2. Other studies have even suggested a correlation between the death penalty and higher crime rates. States such as Texas and Oklahoma, which have very high execution rates, also have higher crime rates than most states that do not have the death penalty2. 1 Amnesty International.

One small but important reason on why the death penalty is a good idea is that it decreases the prisoner population, which saves even more tax payers money.

The case for this would be Kenneth Allen McDuff who was on Death Row when the death penalty was declared unconstitutional in the 1970's.

14,2,31788,"There are several purposes to any punishment: retribution, deterrence and protection of society. The death penalty adequetely satisfies each of these. Justice The death penalty is just. When a person inflicts an evil upon society, he merits evil towards himself. This is why when people rape, rob, cheat and lie, they are punished. Indeed, if they go without being punished, we suddenly feel the injustice. The punishment should also reflect the severity of the crime. A person who steals $5 should be punished less than a rapist. Thus, a murderer should be punished very heavily. The only thing that can equal life in value is life. Thus, in the case of murder, the only just penalty is death. Deterrence The death penalty also deters crimes. Many studies have shown that as the death penalty increases, murders decrease and vice versa. /> /> Protects Society The death penalty protects society because it not only decreases murder rates, but also because a dead person is infinitely less dangerous than an alive person.

14,1,36052,"I argue for the use of the death penalty for many reasons, the first of which is its' effectiveness. If we legalize the death penalty and actually put it into use, people who commit crimes will think twice about actually doing them. Right now, in most states, if you commit a really bad crime, you get to go to jail. However, if the punishment was the death penalty, people would probably be less likely to commit crimes because the punishment is severe. A second argument for the death penalty is the other punishments. If you commit a severe crime (that should be worthy of the death penalty) in some states, you just get a lifetime sentence to prison. So, basically, you spend the rest of your life in captivity with plain food, constant surveillance, etc. and who would want to live a life like that. So, I don't see much of a difference between the death penalty and a lifetime sentence because, in both cases, you are taking the rest of their life away from them. A third argument for the death penalty is the cost of prisoners. According to the link below, the total cost to feed and supply housing for prisoners per year is approximately $63.4 Billion. All that money falls upon tax payers to pay. And that is a lot of money to pay for people who are spending the rest of their lives in vain.

14,13,12897,"The state has a responsibility to protect the lives of innocent citizens, and enacting the death penalty may save lives by reducing the rate of violent crime. The reasoning here is simple- fear of execution can play a powerful motivating role in convincing potential murderers not to carry out their acts. While the prospect of life in prison may be frightening, surely death is a more daunting prospect. Thus, the risk of execution can change the cost-benefit calculus in the mind of murderers-to be so that the act is no longer worthwhile for them1. Numerous studies support the deterrent effect of the death penalty. A 1985 study by Stephen K. Layson at the University of North Carolina showed that a single execution deters 18 murders. Another influential study, which looked at over 3,054 counties over two decades, further found support for the claim that murder rates tend to fall as executions rise2. On top of this, there are ways to make the death penalty an even more effective deterrent than it is today. For instance, reducing the wait time on death row prior to execution can dramatically increase its deterrent effect in the United States1.

1,22,41308,"Politicians have transformed the minimum wage into an indicator of social development. Governments often cite their raising of the minimum wage as an example of their commitment to fostering social justice and equality. This is all nonsense. The minimum wage is nothing more than a useful, simple tool that politicians can exploit without addressing underlying social and economic ills in society.[1] During times of economic expansion wages are generally rising as new businesses are formed and existing firms take on more capacity and workers. During such times, raising the minimum wage has no effect other than being a useful political move. In times of economic contraction, firms close and lay off workers and unemployment rates rise. In such times, the minimum wage hampers the market from clearing, keeping more people out of work than necessary. For markets to function efficiently, wages must be allowed to fluctuate freely, equilibrating with demand for labor and reflecting the macroeconomic situation. Minimum wages tend to lock in wages at pre-recession levels making countries less competitive and less quick to recover when economic downturns occur. Furthermore, minimum wages can often make countries unattractive for businesses to invest in, as the cost of hiring workers can serve as a serious disincentive. For this reason, businesses tend to locate in countries with no minimum wage laws, such as Germany, or where they are comparably low. In order to stay competitive, to bolster economic dynamism and gain global competitiveness, countries should treat labor like the commodity it is and allow the labor market to self-correct, and not institute minimum wage laws.

To raise the minimum wage you legislate a law where EVERY COMPANY must raise the wages of all of its workers to that wage or above. If you change the minimum wage to $10.10 no company can pay a worker less than $10.10. On a completely unrelated note, the American dream is meant to be for Americans. People immigrating from mexico to america do not deserve anything, and especially should not get to decide on our wages. I will not actually explain what happens when you raise the minimum wage. If you raise the lowest amount a person can get paid, the company must pay them more. To compensate for this, the company may raise the prices of its products. Due to this, the only product of a raise of minimum wage is inflation, it does not actually benefit anyone. But raising the minimum wage actually harms people. Companies cannot afford to pay the workers more, will replace them with machines. Then the workers are unemployed. Once they are unemployed they claim more unemployment benefits. Coupled with the fact that the government cannot actually replace their workers so pays them more, the government will lose money.

You can't generalize like that. That point can't be even considered as it is a fallacy 3) You also stated more people will learn if there was the death penalty. But let me prove you wrong here by taking the example of the states who implemented the death penalty in around 33 states I guess. Now before the implementation of the penalty, the crime rates were very high, over 12,000 registered. And after thee penalty was implemented, there was no reduction in the crime rate! so your point is not valid as the fear in most of the criminals is gone. In fact most criminals are ready to die after committing a crime than rather go to prison. So by giving him the death sentence is giving him the ticket to heave. But by giving him a life imprisonment, well that's the punishment. So having proved your points in your last argument are also redundant, I strongly stand against the death penalty.

The resolution is slightly confusing as Abdab stated that he/she is against the death penalty yet he is Con against the notion of ""Imprisonment for life is a better punishment than death penalty"" but no matter, here is a few easy clarification. Please ignore the original Con/Pro positions as well as the resolution and take these into considerations. Abdab will be against the death penalty, I will be for it. Abdab you ready? Let's begin. Argument I - Death penalty is more sane than life imprisonment Let's assume that all convicts are guilty. Prisoners are likely to commit suicide based on the study conducted by fellow psychologists of the University of Manchester ( The most common method of suicide used are self strangulation, hanging as well burning etc. It is unclear as to what the actual reason for their suicides but results show a disorder that exists amongst prisoners. Most prisoners, in that study specifically, commit suicide just 7 days into their prison life. Moreover, this does not concern a small sample, but it represents a large sample which is highly representative to society, as suicide and murder rates soar( for years. That is just 7 days. A life imprisonment is much more severe and traumatic for the prisoners. If the prisoners are guilty and that they deserve the most severe form of punishment, it is better to choose the death penalty rather than being insane for the rest of your life. Hence the death penalty is better for the serial killers rather than life imprisonment. Assuming that they do deserve severe punishments. I will present my rebuttals in the next round.

14,27,12897,"Juries are imperfect1, and increasing the stakes of the verdict can pervert justice in a couple of ways. First, implementation of the death penalty is often impacted by jury members' social, gender-based or racial biases2, disproportionately impacting certain victimized groups in society and adding a certain arbitrariness to the justice system. A 2005 study found that the death penalty was three to four times more common amongst those who killed whites than those who killed African Americans or Latinos, while those who kill women are three and a half times more likely to be executed than those who kill men2. Regional differences in attitudes towards the death penalty can also introduce elements of randomness into sentencing. For instance, in Illinois, a person is five times more likely to get a death sentence for first-degree murder in a rural area than in Cook County2. Finally, the fear of wrongful execution can also pervert justice by biasing juries towards returning an innocent verdict when they would otherwise be deemed guilty3. When they are told that the consequence of a guilty verdict is death, they are likely to find some kind of reasonable doubt to avoid being responsible for the death of that criminal. This means that more criminals who would've otherwise been convicted do not get charged. In this sense the death penalty can pervert the goals of justice and prolong the difficult process for victims' families. 1 ""Saving Lives and Money."" The Economist. March 12, 2009.

There are many reasons for this argument, firstly in a lot of cases (admittedly in the past, but it is still an issue) innocent convicts have been put to death. This may be the result of lack of evidence to prove the case otherwise, death penalty being imposed before all the evidence has been found, or unjust power (such as is the case of Sacco and Vanzetti) Another reason that the death penalty should not be legal, is that new drugs being tested on convicts are inhumane, as with the recent cases heard in the news, one where a man suffered for over 10 minutes before he finally passed away. I realise that these are bad people, and in the eyes of the law, and in the eyes off the mass majority, they need to be punished, however, we must remember that they are still people at the end of the day, and killing them because they killed somebody else does nothing for anyone.

DNA evidence has already proven some thought to be criminals as innocent. New inventions in technology may also free innocents as DNA technology has, but If they have already been executed it is too late for them to freed. The small deterrence effect of the death penalty is nowhere near effective enough to justify the financial cost of the death penalty in the United States nor the possibility of executing innocent civilians.

14,26,12897,"The fact that juries are prone to several biases is not a flaw inherent or unique to capital punishment. If there are racial or prejudicial issues in sentencing, these are likely to present themselves just as often in cases where the punishment is life in prison. It is equally problematic for people to die or spend decades in jails for crimes they did not commit. These errors suggest that the judicial process may need some reform, not that the death penalty should be abolished. Implementation errors that result in discrimination can and should be corrected. Moreover, there is little evidence that these biases are even present in most death penalty cases1. A study funded by the National Institute of Justice in the US found that differences in sentencing for white and non-white victims disappeared when the heinousness of the crimes were factored into the study1. Thus, factors relating to the crime, not the race, of the accused accounted for some of the purported racial disparities that were found. Finally, jurors must be ""death- qualified"" in such cases, meaning that they are comfortable sentencing someone to death should the fact indicate their guilt2.

My opponent does not really make any suggestion that JB is in fact NOT part of an assassination plot, so my argument still stands. As for Obama not hating JB, I have a video that suggests otherwise. In addition, Obama doesn't even have a single JB song on his iPad. [1] Thus it can be concluded he is definitely not a fan and at the very least does not like Justin. Locking JB in the stockades and allowing the public to paddle his Bieber buns: the biggest problem is those people who go too far. Do we really want to allow him to get castrated? Well, we stopped the murder plot, so this much is obvious--we don't want him castrated. The people might beat him up to death anyways in YYW's counter-plan, fulfilling my punishment of the death penalty. Moreover, there still remains the problem of the fans JB has. They'll probably revolt against the public and attempt to stop them, as well as talking about their minority rights. Although the majority rules, I think that if we put him in a more secretive area and only allowed haters inside, then JB will definitely be tortured enough and we will allow him to get the death penalty via the people who hate JB.

I argue that a Government is no more responsible for your health care, than it is for raising your children. To demand Government health care, would be shifting the burden of personal health accountability. Health care costs money. The only way to pay for health care is to maintain an employed work-force to contribute taxes for social programs like health care. That makes Government sponsored health care an oxymoron. If you are employed, you have access to company health care. The only people who who actually benefit from Government sponsored health care, are the unemployed. Private health care creates healthy competition between medical providers. It serves as an incentive for doctors to practice quality medicine. Social health care programs would eliminate competition and remove incentive for doctors to provide above-standard care.

13,5,22746,"In conclusion, the massacres at Columbine High School, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, and the 142 school shootings since Sandy Hook, illustrate that military style assault rifles and easily concealed handguns equipped with large capacity ammunition magazines are now the weapons of choice for mass shooters. These semiautomatic weapons are far more powerful and lethal than standard issue law enforcement service weapons. There had been more mass shootings of four or more people in the US than days in the year. The common denominator in almost every one is an assault rifle and high capacity ammunition magazine. The prevalence of mass shootings has people rightly wondering if they are safe sending their children to school or going to malls. An assault weapon ban would not end all gun violence in this country and it might not significantly reduce the average 90 Americans killed by guns each day. But it would help reduce the daily mass shootings. It might also help us begin living without the fear of being massacred in a public place. In conclusion, the banning of assault weapons and high capacity clips would do a lot to decrease gun violence in the United States.

1,10,41308,"Businesses operating in a free market are concerned principally with their bottom lines. In order to increase profits, firms will seek to exploit workers, to lower wages as far as possible. This exploitation will continue indefinitely, unless the state intervenes. The state does so by implementing a minimum wage. The lowest paid workers tend to be less educated, less skilled, and less organized than higher-paid employees. This makes them the easiest to manipulate and the easiest to replace.[1] In order to stop this outright exploitation of the most vulnerable members of society, the power of wage setting must fall to some extent within the purview of the state. Certainly, it is far better for state, which has citizens’ best interest at heart, to weigh in on the issue of setting wages than businesses, which tend not to care about their workers’ welfare or have competing interests. Furthermore, a minimum wage sends a social signal of valuation; it affirms that all people have worth, cannot be exploited, and are owed by dint of their humanity a certain level of treatment in the workforce, i.e. a minimum wage. This is important as a means to assist the self-empowerment of the poorest members of society, by encouraging them to value themselves. Also, the minimum wage aids in promoting social justice and equality by lowering wage disparities.[2] Citizens of more equal societies tend to have more in common and can share more in the construction of societal goals and aims. This form of social justice is certainly preferable to the class divisions propagated in the absence of a minimum wage, in which a part of society is relegated to permanent wage slavery.

Further, in 1991 the University of Maryland published a study in the New England journal of Medicine suggesting the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before 1991, claiming that the ban had prevented 47 deaths in DC per year.5 It is theorised that the handgun ban does this because it makes other police tactics, such as stop and search, significantly more effective. If criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it. However, it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large. Specifically, the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are, but simply can’t pin them for arrest, such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street.  ",1.4300319121420288,True,1.3663220895977592,0.7832587560450059,0.7100254449578458,231,True,1.0991956688015514

1,12,41308,"Without a minimum wage, the lowest paid members of society are relegated to effective serfdom, and their decisions of these members often force others to follow suit, accepting similarly low wages. There is no real freedom of choice for people at this lowest level of the social structure, since they must accept whatever wage is offered in order to feed themselves and their families. Their poverty and desperation for work makes it much more difficult for them to act collectively to bargain for better wages. The minimum wage frees people from this bondage and guarantees them resources with which to make meaningful choices.[1] Without resources there can be no true choice, as all choices would be coerced by necessity. Because people’s choices are intrinsically interconnected, and wages tend to reflect the prevailing pressures of demand and supply, when an individual makes the choice to work for less than anyone else, he necessarily lowers the wage that others can ask, leading to a downward spiral of wages as workers undercut one another, each competing to prove he is worth the least. A minimum wage ensures workers do not harm each other through self-destructive wage competition.[2] What the minimum wage does to alleviate these problems is that it gives individuals the ability to pursue the good life, something that has become a global ideal. People want to be happy, and find that only way to obtain the resources necessary to attain comfort and security is through employment. Fundamentally, the minimum wage grants the freedom not to be exploited, giving individuals the freedom to control their own destinies.

1,5,33408,"First, lets consider what the minimum wage is intended to do. It is intended to prevent bussineses from ""exploiting"" workers. If we don't have it, workers will be paid next to nothing. This is simply not true. Very few workers even work the minimum wage, this is because the more they work, the more value they gain and there wages will rise. People have a choice of were to work, if they want a very low paying job, its because they feel its the best choice. Also, if bussinesses start paying people barely anything, people won't work there. Bussinesses will try to offer the best wages possible to compete for workers. They will also raise the wages of current workers or those workers will find higher paying jobs. The minimum wage harms people in areas where their is high enemployment and the ecomy is bad because bussinisses cant pay minimum wage. In areas of high enemployment people are desprete for work and will work for far less then the minimum wage. The minumum wage keeps them out of the workforce. If you don't have a skill that is worth the minumum wage you are also shut out of the economy, no one will pay you the minimum wage if you are an unskilled labor who isn't producing enough. It stops bussinisses from expanding and hiring others because they must pay minimum wage.

1,2,21879,"I am in strong affirmation of the resolution, which states that the national minimum wage should be increased. I will now give my contentions. Contention 1: A $15/hour minimum wage won't result in major job losses because it would put money in the pockets of millions of low-wage workers who will spend it -- thereby giving working families and the overall economy a boost, and creating jobs. In 1996, we raised the minimum wage, and businesses predicted millions of job losses; in fact, we had more job gains over the next four years than in any comparable period in American history. (Robert Reich, Professor of Public policy, California University Berkeley) Contention 2: Working full time should produce enough money to support a family. In 1968, the minimum wage was high enough to keep a family of three out of poverty. In 1980, the minimum wage was at least high enough to keep a family of two out of poverty. Today, the minimum wage leaves a working parent with one child in poverty. This is fundamentally wrong. (Lawrence Wittner, Professor of History Emeritus) Contention 3: By under-paying workers, corporations are shifting the real costs of doing business to the general public. According to a study released this October by the University of California and the University of Illinois, 52 percent of America's fast food workers receive assistance from public programs like food stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Medicaid, thanks to their poverty-level wages. As a result, taxpayers are contributing $7 billion per year to pick up the cost of supporting these fast-food workers. These taxpayers are paying enormous amounts to support the impoverished employees of Wal-Mart and other giant companies. (Lawrence Wittner, Professor of History Emeritus) This is why I stand in firm affirmation of the resolution.",-0.13387323355795333,True,1.1412457925466737,0.3245137929586479,0.3917661007872458,298,True,0.7149971610614688
1,6,33408,"The two points of this debate are does no minimum wage allow for worker exploitation and does it hurt bussiness. As for worker exploitation, that means that countries with no minimum wages will have higher poverty rates.Germany is one of the only countries without a minimum wage. Their poverty rate is the exact same as ours. In fact, new Mexico and California have minimum wages higher then the rest of the country. The national average is 15%. Calafornai has a poverty rate of 18%. New Mexico's is 21%. The city of San franisico has a the highest minimum wage in the country and it has a poverty rate of 23%. So places with high minimum wages can also have high poverty rates. Not having a minimum wage lifts people out of poverty because it makes it easier to find a job. As for making it more expensive more bussinesess, that's comment sense. You can have less of something that cost more. Any one in us who produces less 7.25 an hour is unhireable.

1,6,25711,"This subject has many opinions between different people, my opposition has brought up many points, some that I disagree. First, he believes that small businesses won't benefit from the minimum wage. But, as I researched more into this subject, I found out that most businesses do in-fact prefer the minimum wage. Because, giving more money to the people lower in the economy will let them be able to buy commercial goods again, meaning that money will now flow through businesses quicker and better then without the minimum wage, making this statement that my opposition told, a myth. Second, we should actually be raising the minimum wage instead. Since 1938, the US have raised the minimum wage an astounding 22 times through the years, and yet at the same time, they had their real GDP per capita raise as well! This is an example that we should acknowledge. Third, I have already talked about this subject, but it is such an important subject. How do we expect to get the economy going when people aren't paying for stuff. Not having a minimum wage means that people could pay less then the amount that is needed for money to go around. Minimum wage is also used to have a pay that will give a good amount of money and also encouraging them to use it on buying more stuff. Also making the money flow from the businesses to the people and back again to the businesses. This is why the minimum wage is top priority to any country, how do we expect a company or even a country to run without a good economy.

1,17,41308,"The state has an obligation to protect people from making bad decisions. Just as it tries to protect people from the harms of drugs by making them illegal, the state protects people from exploitation by setting wages at a baseline minimum. Everyone deserves a living wage, but they will not get this if there is no minimum wage. Businesses ruthlessly seeking to increase profit margins will always seek to reduce wages. This behavior is particularly harmful to those who receive the lowest wages. Upholding the right to work for any wage does not give people on the lowest wages a real choice, since it means people must work for what they are given, resulting in terrible exploitation.[1] Clearly, the minimum wage is a necessary safeguard for the protection of the weak and the vulnerable, and to guard people from unconscionable choices that an absolute right to work would force. Furthermore, the right to work does not mean much if an individual can only find employment in jobs which pay so lowly that they cannot support themselves. Thus, there is little difference between being employed below the minimum wage and being unemployed at the minimum wage. When employed, a person is no longer on unemployment statistics and the government has less pressure to act. When unemployed, they have the incentive and time to campaign for government action.

2,2,14667,"""The government already receives enough income from other taxes, and income tax seems unfair to those who already make little money."" That is a personal opinion. Obviously, given the massive deficit, the government is not making enough money even with the income tax, let alone without it. And since the income tax is prorated, those that don't make much money at all, don't even pay an income tax. Thanks to deductions for children and the EITC, a family of four making $30,000 a year is likely not going to pay any income taxes to the feds. [1] I feel the need to correct my opponent. Our first federal income tax was signed into law in 1861, and modified (into a progressive income tax) in 1862. This tax expired in 1866. [2] ""And be it further enacted, that the duties on incomes herein imposed shall be due and payable on or before the thirtieth day of June, in the year eighteen hundred and sixty-three, and in each year thereafter until and including the year eighteen hundred and sixty-six and no longer."" It wasn't until 1894 that the income tax was revisited and applied as a peacetime tax via the revenue act. [3] So your claim that they lied to us is false. They correctly said that the income tax would end after the war (which it did) and it was a different government over 30 years later that brought it back on new terms. That refutes all arguments posted so far. Thank you, [1] [2] [3]",-1.0722163209779427,True,0.982286423867162,0.9860785429253288,1.4653910850474623,255,True,1.3191094112012058

You can see this by all the rioting and protesting going on all over America. The more rude or harsh police officers will only enhance this current issue in America leading to more rioting, protests, and untrust in the police force leading to more casualties on the Police forces side. If the police would treat people kinder it would calm all of the rioting and protests and help restore trust with citizens and police officers.

Once he gave a lawful order for her to get on the ground she is required by law to comply, and if she fails to comply, the officer has the legal authority to use force. Force often times looks ugly, it isn't a pretty thing, but as a society, we've granted the police the authority to use it under certain circumstances, in this circumstance the officer's actions fell with normal police procedure. With that said, I have no doubt the officer could've handled the situation in a way that could've had better results and would've never led up to this incidence. Him coming in hot headed and using filthy language was inappropriate, but once somebody fails to obey a lawful command, and officer of the law is authorized to use force, in order to get the individual to comply, the officer did nothing wrong in his attempt to subdue the girl.

5,13,30771,"There is a growing body of evidence linking a healthy lifestyle, comprising of both adequate nutrition and physical exercise, with improved memory, concentration and general academic performance.[1] A study has shown that when primary school students consume three or more junk food meals a week literacy and numeracy scores dropped by up to 16% compared to the average.[2] This is a clear incentive for governments to push forward for healthier meals in schools for two reasons. The first obvious benefit is to the student, whose better grades award her improved upward mobility – especially important for ethnic groups stuck worst by the obesity epidemic and a lower average socioeconomic status. The second benefit is to the schools, who benefit on standardized testing scores and reduced absenteeism, as well as reduced staff time and attention devoted to students with low academic performance or behavior problems and other hidden costs of low concentration and performance of students.[3] [1] CDC, 'Student Health and Academic Achievement', 19 October 2010, http://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/health_and_academics/, accessed 9/11/2011 [2] Paton, Graeme, ‘Too much fast food ‘harms children’s test scores’’, The Telegraph, 22 May 2009, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/5368637/Too-much-fast-food-harms-childrens-test-scores.html accessed 20 September 2011 [3] Society for the Advancement of Education, 'Overweight students cost schools plenty', December 2004, http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1272/is_2715_133/ai_n8551551/?tag=mantle_skin;content, 9/11/2011  ",-1.0722163209779427,True,0.5700278672245163,0.4002697310796427,1.3468032652555972,206,True,0.8941899769655453

By the time the government hires people to put them in, pays for the camera and the electric to run the thousands of cameras, hires people to monitor and scan through all of the pictures, and sends out tickets, it is barely worth it to even have.

In the UK 28 gun crimes are committed every day.[1] Much public opinion holds that something must be done to tackle this.[2] The sight of armed police officers patrolling the streets will not only deter gangs from harassing residents, but will instil in communities a confidence that they are being properly protected. Gangs are not interested in fighting the police; they are more concerned about attacks from other gangs in their area who are willing to break the law and attack them unprovoked. People feel safer when they see armed police, especially if they perceive them as a response to a heightened risk.

It does this by providing common standards, making it possible for teachers and schools to adjust their methods accordingly, based on whether their students are reaching these standards or not. As Claudia Wallis describes of American national testing, everyone can 'agree that the law's greatest accomplishment has been shinning an unforgiving light on such languishing schools and demanding that they do better'1. At Blaine, an American primary school with a history of failure, the number of fifth to eighth-graders reading on grade level or above rose from 13% to 36% after the introduction of national testing1. The pressure placed on the school to be accountable, and the threat of sanctions and sackings if they did not improve, can be thanked for this improvement. 1 Wallis, C., & Steptoe, S. (2007, May 24).

Tests are different between each school and each teacher often. This allows for some student not to have learned things while others have. Which creates an unbalanced classroom where some students are struggling to learn material and others are bored because they had already learned it. In fact a study has shown that 79% of students think that standard tests are fair. My opponent is also worried that it restricts creativity of thinking. A test is to test your knowledge. Grades 1-12 are there to teach you the basics of a wide range of knowledge. Tests are there to see if you get what you are learning. Standard tests already have questions that promote creative thinking. Teaching for the test is a good thing. It eliminates time wasting activities. It focuses on the content and that way the students will all learn the same thing and no student will be left behind. Standardized tests do not narrow the curriculum. It focuses the curriculum. The multiple choice is actually helpful in improving the education system because it produces accurate information. Also the markings for standardized tests are fair. Teacher markings are not fair because the teacher may not like a child and mark their test harder than others. If you don't believe me China is living proof that standard tests work.

This policy gives greater powers to officers to simply stop people on the street and detain them if they don't have the requisite papers. To lower the chance of being caught by police officers, illegal immigrants will be less willing to interact on a regular basis with the rest of society. They will simply go into hiding and avoid being out in public or places that would expose them to police officers. This will firstly make the policy virtually ineffective as police officers still don't (and will never get) the ability to march into peoples' homes and demand immigration papers, but also forces greater ghettoisation as the immigrants will have greater incentive to form their own societies away from police. This will also have an effect on the people who employ illegal immigrants, as they do not want to lose the cheap labour. They will further want to hide their employees to stop them being caught and to stop themselves from facing prosecution. This will create a poorer relationships between these businesses and the police. Finally, the immigrants will not want to use services such as the police to help them with criminal issues.

But that's no reason on why to draw your weapon . I do understand sometimes especially at night it's a lot harder to identify what the person you pulled over or the person who apprehended on what they may have or have but that's why you search them instead of straight up aim a gun and threaten and perhaps even go as far tackling , pepper spraying, taserinh or throwing the person down because you feel they did wrong . Police officers are here to serve and protect not shoot on sight . Not even soldiers in Iraq do that because shooting a person atleast for a normal person is scarring and could change a person mentally and emotionally . Honestly a police officer can't just point a weapon because they're ""scarred"" or feel that the person is suspect.

Parents seeking to discipline their children may resort to violence, an outcome made more likely if those parents were educated in a school system that condoned physical punishment for misbehaviour1.

When corporal punishment is banned in both school and the home, parents and teachers are forced to devise alternative punishments that do not involve potentially abusive physical discipline. Such punishments, like detention and reduction of allowance money, can be just as, if not more, effective than corporal punishment while avoiding all of its potential side effects. Furthermore, when physical discipline is not considered a socially acceptable means of punishment, abuse rates tend to fall, as individuals become less prone to resorting to physical castigation. 1: Green, Frederick. 1988.

He simply insists that they're different. My opponent states that Washington DC has a low murder rate because they banned guns. Well, look, Indianapolis has a much lower murder rate, and guns aren't banned there. There aren't even bans on assault weapons in Indiana (1). What basis do we have to believe that gangsters and shooters couldn't get guns if we banned them? Also, if we banned guns from police officers, they wouldn't be able to enforce the law. What if there were a female police officer going up against an enormous gangster? What if the gangs still had guns, and the police don't? Banning guns won't make guns magically disappear. Drugs are banned, but they still get into the US. So gangs will still have access to guns, and depriving police officers of guns will make them essentially ineffective. What are you going to do when a gang member has a gun, and is shooting people, but none of the police officers have guns?

Death penalty should exist because when someone commits a crime that's so violent the end result can cause hundreds to die. If there is no death penalty then the maniac will still kill more people. Death penalty is used to get rid of bad people so bad that hundreds die. If you think the Death penalty is bad because it kills people you must not know what the purpose of it is. The death penalty is a way to put fear into the criminal and to put fear into others. Crime has decreased and the death penalty still lives.

To say that we are lowering ourselves to that level is wrong. Killing over 200 innocent lives. We have to look as well at the possibilities of these criminals committing crimes again.

17,5,32182,"Racial profiling is not intended to solve murder crimes. It in fact harms the prosecution of murder crimes by reducing community trust in the police, reducing the police ability to gain useful evidence. Racial profiling is primarily used to prosecute drug crimes, which as I demonstrated earlier, are in fact not more prevalent in Latino and Black communities. Additionally, while Blacks commit a large portion of murders, the degree is consistent with what you would expect from the racial profiling ""boost"" in numbers. In Ferguson specifically, traffic stops routinely targeted Black residents of the city despite the fact that there was not a statistical basis to believe that they had a higher level of criminality than white residents. This has created a situation in which the police force and the community they serve have an antagonistic relationship. This makes police officers more likely to resort to force, and it makes the community more likely to object to that force being used. This hinders the ability of the police to operate, and makes them less effective as a crime-fighting force. In a situation where the police and the community are antagonistic, the officer and the individual being stopped are both more likely to feel threatened and take poorly-considered action. While the police officer might have felt threatened by their loss of control of the situation, the individual being targeted by the officer likely would feel threatened as well. Communities that are not targeted by the police usually have a much less antagonistic relationship with the police. If you know that the police are not going to assume you are involved in criminality, you are much more likely to cooperate with police and provide them with information, assisting in the prosecution of criminals.",-0.4466542626979497,True,0.815202806431659,1.179707277961979,0.6572222351669295,291,False,1.017033864359177

Tyranny cannot gain hold where the people have not only the will but the means to throw off a tyrannical government.

Guns give the police a big advantage, but if you take away the guns, the police lose a lot of protection. And though the bill will create a unit to confinscate guns, their will always be illegal sales of guns. So police will not only be going against unarmed people, but also people armed with guns, while they have close to nothing.

So would keeping accuracy on comparing DNA and keeping track of the DNA gain be important too? In Arizona of 2001, Kathryn Troyer, a crime lab analyzer, ran tests on Arizona""s DNA database when she saw genes of two felons that almost matched. They matched 9 out of the 13 locations on a chromosomes, or loci. Loci are usually used to compare DNA because they are easily distinguishable. The FBI estimated the odds of finding unrelated people having similar genetic loci to be 1 in 113 billion. Troyer found the felons were unrelated and of different races. Troyer has found dozens of similar ""matches,"" showing that the accuracy of the base isn""t as clear as thought. When Troyer discovered this, many states looked for only 9 or fewer loci when looking for suspects (most try to compare 13 loci when evidence is reasonable). Troyer and her colleagues believed that a 9-locus match could mislead investigators to finding the wrong person. ""We felt it was interesting and just wanted people to understand it could happen,"" Troyer explained. ""If you""re going to search at nine loci, you need to be aware of what it means. It""s not necessarily absolutely the guy,"" added Troyer""s colleague, Phoenix Lab Director, Todd Griffith. Inspired by these findings, defense attorney Bicka Barlow sought to find out if there might be other matches in a DNA database. She started a new search of the Arizona database, she found that there was 122 individuals that matched at the same 9 of the 13 loci with 20 people that matched 10 out of 65,000 felons.

17,14,5236,"When a police officer carries a weapon, she faces the risk of having that weapon turned on her by a criminal. It is also more obvious to a criminal that they need to shoot first against an armed officer whereas against an unarmed one they may be more open to listening and less likely to try and pre-empt being shot. So arming the police can sometimes make the police more vulnerable, rather than more protected. If, as the opposing argument suggests, legally owned guns are part of the risk profile facing the police, measures ought to be taken to reduce the risk and restrict levels of gun ownership.  The police have had a National (legal) Firearms Database since 2006 allowing them to assess whether someone they will be dealing with is a gun owner or whether the premises they are attending contains licensed firearms. Criminal misuse of illegal firearms is a different matter although, as has been argued, protection and safety are not the same as ‘armed’ and more armed police will probably mean more shootings and, equally probably, more mistakes and armed confrontations.[1] [1] P.

20,12,25908,"A two-state solution can offer sufficient territory for both Israelis and Palestinians. For Israel this would mean keeping the vast majority of areas inhabited by Israeli citizens within the state of Israel. The two-state solution would also, however, offer sufficient land to the Palestinians. While cynics might question the size of the West Bank and Gaza, optimists should look no further than Singapore for reassurance. The area of the West Bank and Gaza is nine times as large as Singapore's, yet the combined population of Palestinians in both regions is smaller than that of Singapore. Singapore enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the world. The Palestinians are capable of achieving similar success, through instituting a modern economy based on science, technology and the benefits of peace.(1) Moreover, throughout the years polls have consistently showed respectable Israeli and Palestinian majorities in favour of a negotiated two-state settlement.(6) Even the Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinezhad has stated that Iran would support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The success of a two-state solution, therefore, would, at a minimum, gain the support and possibly cooperation of the Iranians. This would be valuable diplomatically, particularly in resolving the larger conflict between Iran and the West.(7) Therefore, the best way to satisfy both sides and achieve peace is to adopt a two-state solution, which is therefore the most just solution.",1.4300319121420288,True,1.2503671973503632,1.9340260628465118,2.4114446909518987,228,True,2.162749662631932
17,11,33583,"State employees- including members of the security and police services- encounter conflicts of interest throughout their working lives. A police officer may become involved in a case in which a member of his or her family is suspect. A civil servant or local council worker may be required to determine whether friends, family or a partner should receive a state funded subsidy. The impartiality of state servants may be called into question in circumstances where their own background, whether personal or professional, may appear to undermine their ability to impartially implement the decisions and policies of the executive. Structured, accountable and responsive civil service organisations recognise that such occurrences are routine and inevitable. Consequently, all western liberal democratic states incorporate a degree of flexibility into official bodies that wield delegated powers. The size of organisations such as the police means that conflicts of interest will continually threaten their impartiality, but employees of these organisations are made aware that their roles and duties may be restructured in order to avoid such conflicts. Police officers can be deployed to duties that will not bring them into contacts with families members or friends. Moreover, internal procedures in most public sector organisations punish attempts to conceal possible conflicts of interest, but go to pains to point out that the fact of the conflict’s existence will not prejudice an employee’s chances or promotion or make their position less secure. Judges are educated and trained to recognise even more remote and tenuous forms of personal bias than a familial link to the defendant or claimant in a particular case.

13,9,16132,"Opposition agrees that handguns have unique advantages over other weapons; however, banning handguns in this area would lead to worse problems which are mentioned here as well as in the first point of opposition. The biggest issue with banning handguns, especially in a city, is that handguns will still be available to criminal classes willing to simply import the weapons from elsewhere. Due to their concealable nature it is very easy for them to smuggle handguns into an area where a handgun ban has been imposed. This is problematic because law abiding citizens in this area will now not have guns to defend themselves with. As such an asymmetry of power has been created where the people who bear guns, mainly criminals have weapons which give them significantly more power than the citizens in that area. Under the status quo, the legality of handguns means that although they are more dangerous than other weapons, their availability works in citizens’ favour. This is because the asymmetry of power mentioned above is then weighted in the other direction. If a large proportion of the population have handguns for self-defence then there will be a greater chance that criminals attempting to commit violent acts will encounter individuals carrying weapons, resulting in an equality of power between both attacking and defending parties. The asymmetry is then pushed towards the defensive parties because presumably there are more law abiding citizens than criminals. As such those who wish to use guns for defensive purposes outnumber those who want to use guns for criminal purposes, weighting power in favour of those defending themselves. This is verified by the incredibly common use of handguns in self-defence; roughly 80% of self-defence actions involve handguns.4",1.1172508830020322,True,0.8281107197955778,0.15597918445333525,1.0381272774030321,285,False,0.7788262645073577

One of the most effective ways to promote your work, organization, or even themselves through social networking sites.

The first advantage is that social networking sites will assist in the launch of a comprehensive strategy to promote the brand. 2.Social networking websites to promote friendship, take a break, travel partners, and even a spouse. The main idea is to create a platform where people from counties and cultures can meet and share a part of their lives with other people.

Good:'excellence or merit' Harm:'physical injury or mental damage' Going off those meanings I would say when people say that 'social networking sites do more harm than good' that if their children or brothers, sisters even go on social networking sites that they are saying that either they have been physically harmed by social networking or they have been mentally harmed which would cause them to go slightly loopy and they wouldn't be able go on the site.

This is, to put it simply, a waste of money. It costs much less money to keep people convicted of high felonies locked up under maximum security, and it would also create jobs in security.

The difference between a law against crime and a universal background gun law is that the former prevents a crime, while another prevents gun ownership, even though you can not legally use a gun for crimes in the first place, since there are already crime laws. If someone follows the crime law, no one gets hurt; if someone follows a background check law, and they are denied a gun, they have no chance if someone threatens their life with a gun, even if it is by a convicted felon, who broke the law to get the gun. Gun control does not save lives from criminals, who get the guns illegally, it only makes it extremely difficult for law abiding citizens to defend themselves, which is why there is more murder (per GDP, per population, whatever) in places with gun control, and less in places where the criminal knows people are free to defend themselves with a gun if the criminal attacks them.

13,5,40774,Concealed carry laws do not make guns less bad as guns are not bad to begin with. Concealed carry laws only make guns better. It can be agreed that the majority of citizens are good law abiding people who do not wish to cause harm to others. Concealed carry laws only insure that it is only the good citizens who get access to the guns. However as the number of law abiding citizens surpasses that of the criminals allowing free access would still be a good course of action. Criminals are less likely to attack if they knew everyone was armed and when they do decide to attack the gun of the citizens can be used in defense. This means that more guns equals both lower crime attempts and a lower amount of crimes being successfully carried out. While a gun may make it easier to commit a homicide a homicide will not occur without the people wanting to commit a homicide. Most people you meet would not want to commit a homicide sometimes even in face of danger. This means that while it would be easier for people to commit homicide the rates should not increase People who do wish to kill are firstly less likely to worry about consequences for breaking gun control law than murder and will not have a problem obtaining guns illegally Even if they were not able to obtain a gun illegally if they wanted to kill someone they likely would do so anyway just with a different method In spur of the moment decisions where one will commit homicide it is likely that even without a gun it will be committed using another method.

These types of people are not under the criteria of criminally insane, but instead the dangerously unfit to be a part of society. Normally, I believe in life sentences for serial killer or rapist cases, but death penalties should always be held as a reserve punishment when times are economically hard as it is costly to keep life sentences. Death sentences should also only be reserved for the individuals who are so incapable of being a functional member of civilization that no sentence would be able to mentally repair their state of mind and it would be necessary to execute them in the name of order.

7,13,42399,"Minimum sentences have only a theoretical impact on crime rates; in reality they make no difference. The pro makes two major assumptions; first, that criminals have reasonably accurate perceptions of the legal code. Second, the pro assumes that harsh penalties have a psychological impact on potential criminals. Interviews with convicted felons found that a mere 22% even thought they knew what the punishment would be. Another 18% did not know at all, and more than a third reported that they had not thought about punishment at all at the time of the crime.[1] Thus minimum sentences are not sufficiently well publicized to have a significant deterrent effect. Furthermore, substantial evidence demonstrates that additional severity has a relatively small deterrent effect. Criminals respond much more to the chance of getting caught rather than the consequences that occur if they get caught; if a criminal’s chance of getting caught is 10%, the deterrent effect is virtually zero.[2] Thus mandatory sentences do not have a substantial deterrent effect.

Getting a concealed carry permit does not mean you can get a pistol that day. Those who get these have to go through several steps, including background checks, fingerprinting, and classes on shooting. Someone who has a concealed carry will be able to hit a target rather proficiently. Adding to that, teachers should already be background checked, so there is less of a chance of an unsavory character being in possession of a weapon while being around children. 2. The guns would need to be out of reach of the students, but having a gun in the classroom that the teacher can easily get to means that the chance of survival if a shooter targets the classroom much higher. 3. Criminals historically target those who they think are unarmed and vulnerable. They will not attack a place that is able to easily defend themselves, because many shooters want media attention, which will happen if they create a massacre, not if they are the only casualty. 4.

These skills are a necessary aspect of 21st century life.

I Love Lightening McQueen!') and many are simply unbelievably fun. I have noticed that my children are no less active than others whose parents are not as screen-time positive. I also seek out and encourage play with more activity oriented electronic media, such as Nintendo's Wii. Ultimately, however, it is the very nature of screen time, which encourages a kind of focused attention and unique immersive thinking, that I think really benefits children whether or not they are standing up to play.

Electronic voting also brings the opportunity to increase access to those who currently find it difficult to register their votes; for example, electronic voting could be conducted in a minority language for those who find English difficult[4]. In the past, trials of this have been shown to improve voter turnout among minority groups[5].

It is also a disadvantage for those who with a limited income and education, who are ‘most likely to not use the internet or even understand how to use a computer’[5]. 37% of low-income households do not regularly use the internet[6]; this motion would create a two-tier system where already under-represented groups are allowed to fall behind the rest of society.

If electronic or internet voting was introduced as an option alongside more traditional polling methods, it would expands the accessibility of the voting system in general. Internet or electronic voting would be a strategic practical measure. It would make voting convenient for busy modern citizens because it minimalises the amount of effort each individual has to contribute – namely, they do not have to travel to the polling stations[4]. As such, it removes physical restrictions on the voting process and becomes more universally accessible. This would prevent people from being unable to vote because they are ‘too busy’[5] – whether this is simply because their local polling station is too far away for them to commute to, or to fit in alongside their other daily responsibilities based at work or home[6][7].

Young people are not completely detached from the political or the non-electronic world. Many are passionate about politics and exercising their right to vote[2]. Low voter turnout is a general trend across the nation, and if young people are failing to vote then this too reflects disillusionment with government. For example, many young people who voted for the Liberal Democrats in the UK recently were shocked when he expressly went against his promise to prevent tuition fee rises[3]. Political disillusionment among young people is also a problem in the USA[4] and Europe[5]. It is the state of politics itself, rather than the literal process of voting, which deters people from full political participation.

High-profile candidates, like Bill Clinton, are often touted for the job, but are almost always rejected as unpalatable to some of the permanent member states. For instance, figures like Charles De Gaulle or Dwight Eisenhower are rumored to have been considered for the first Secretary-General position[1], but were rejected in favor of the uncontroversial Norwegian, Trygve Lie. Thus excellent leaders and statesmen are outright excluded from the selection process because the permanent five have no incentive to nominate a strong, forceful figure for the role. Popular election would reverse this bias, as only well-known international heavy-weight figures would be able to gain sufficient votes from citizens all over the world.

8,17,30807,"There would be clear advantages in having elections while young people are still in school as school could help prepare them for the elections. Schools would be able to teach their students in advance what the ballot is like, about the process of voting, and most importantly about the European Union and the function of the European Parliament. One of the biggest problems with the European Parliament is that voters don’t understand what it does. To take a couple of basics from a Eurobarometer poll in 2011, 42% of European citizens did not know MEPs were directly elected and 57% did not know that they sit in the Parliament according to ideology not nationality.[1] This shows how necessary education about the European Parliament is. Having elections at 16 provides an ideal opportunity as it means that most will participate in a European election while they are at school. Teaching about why voting matters would also help to improve turnout. When Austria reduced its voting age to 16 it was found that turnout from 16-17 year olds was significantly higher than turnout for 18-19 year olds when both groups are first time voters.[2] This suggests that 18 may simply be the wrong time to introduce people to voting for the first time. Since voting or not voting tends to be habit forming lowering the voting age could slowly increase turnout across the board.

Compulsory voting merely sweeps under the carpet the legitimate dissatisfaction many people feel with politics, and will not lead to the regeneration of politics that its proponents suggest. Many people will merely vote at random, because 'they have to', rather than expressing their apathy.

It is because they feel as though they aren't represented and do not think its worth the time if there vote does not count. And by implementing a test that slows that process down even more it would simply lead to a larger loss in voter turnout. How much would you offer to vote? The amount offered would have to be a state decision, which would just lead to political corruption. States that are predominately one party would offer almost no payment so that voter turnout doesn't change, while battleground states would offer incentives making them even more important to candidates, which would just corrupt the system even more. I am not suggesting paying voters at all. But to further illustrate the flaw in paying individuals to show up to vote. You have to consider that many of them are at work and cannot lose the 1-4 hours of work. So in order to incentivize them to show up to vote you have to at least meet their requirement for work. So assuming everyone who voted was payed minimum wage, and there were 126 million people who voted in the 2012 election[1]. so with simple math (126 million x 7.25 minimum wage) =913.5 million dollars. And assuming this process worked you would have higher voter turnout meaning that this price would be higher. By offering a billion dollars in incentives to vote, you are basically bribing for votes.

8,6,9946,"Essentially, the debate comes down to two points. ==Decision Making== I have shown that mentally retarded people often cannot make an educated decision. My opponent claims that ""they can only get it wrong half of the time."" First of all, there are multiple parties for a reason. Simple because only two of them have been elected to office in quite a while does not mean the others do not receive any votes. Secondly, half of the time is a large number! An estimated 26.2 percent of Americans ages 18 and older — about one in four adults — suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year! [1] That is about one fourth of american citizens of eligible voting age. Are you trying to tell me that a number as large as that cannot sway an election? Allowing these people to vote would completely invalidate the voting process. ==Protection== First of all, equating America to post WWI Germany is completely off-center. In the United States, the president does not hold enough power to exterminate people with disabilities unless agreed upon by congress. (Which would never happen) I am only arguing that the mentally ill should not be able to vote for the president, not that they should not vote for congressmen. Therefore, they are in no danger. Allowing the mentally retarded to vote compromises American votes. Since this is such a valuable right that we are privileged to hold, we must not let it be marred by the uneducated vote. Even if the mentally ill only get the vote wrong half of the time, it is still invalid! To uphold the validity of our votes, the resolution must be negated.

A one-state solution, however, would undermine Israel's legitimacy and internationally recognized right to exist as a sovereign Jewish state in the land of the Jewish forefathers. From Israel's perspective, it is not possible for the Jewish people to accept an arrangement that signifies the end of the existence of a Jewish state, which would be the result of a one-state solution, as the state could not be considered a Jewish one if it housed a very large Palestinian population, possibly even a Palestinian majority.(1) For this reason it is unlikely that any one-state solution would be truly democratic, and rather would be a situation of an Israeli minority ruling over a Palestinian majority, who would be largely excluded from the running of the country and determining their own affairs.(4) A one-state solution would only produce an explosive situation in which Jews would dominate the economy and most other aspects of the new state, creating a reality of exploitation. At that point in time, the new state would be a new form of occupation that would only set the conflict on a more violent track.(5) Therefore, the new state created by a one-state solution would be unacceptable either to Israelis or to Palestinians, as it would cease to be either Jewish or democratic, and so would not be a just outcome.

Moreover, the two-state solution denies Palestinian refugees their internationally recognized right of return.”(14) A two-state solution, particularly one that enables a Jewish state, would also most likely alienate the Palestinian population remaining within Israel. At best, they would be second class citizens. At worst, they would be pushed out, directly or indirectly.(13) A two-state solution, and the establishment of a Jewish state, would also kill the idea of the return of Palestinian refugees that were expelled from Israel during various wars and conflicts.

Between the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights (all outside of Israel's 1967 borders), over 400,000 Israelis live in settlements in the occupied territories.[1] These ever-expanding settlements represent a barrier to Israeli withdrawing to its 1967 borders. In 1993, when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat famously shook hands on the White House lawn, there were only 109,000 Israelis living in settlements across the West Bank (not including Jerusalem). Today there are more than 230 settlements and strategically placed 'outposts' designed to cement a permanent Jewish presence on Palestinian land.[2] Forcibly removing these settlers would be too difficult, could foment a kind of Jewish civil war, and would create a level of resentment among fundamentalist Jews that would likely inflame the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Furthermore it should be remembered that these settlers are Israeli citizens, with families, who moved to these areas because the Israeli government told them it was safe and that they would be allowed to stay, and thus Israel has a moral duty to live up to these promises by not withdrawing. Israel cannot afford this sort of internal turmoil, and should not neglect its duty to protect the rights of these citizens, and so it should not withdraw to its 1967 borders.

20,22,37038,"Before the discussion of the Palestinians as the innocent victims of Israeli oppression can be established, it should be noted that the Palestinian leadership were full participants in rejecting the 1948 partition plan and the war that followed. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem rejected any form of compromise, and urged the removal of the region’s Jewish population, while massacres of Jewish settlers at Palestinian hands and the complete elimination of the Jewish presence in the areas of Palestine that the Israelis did not secure in 1948 speaks to a certain degree of popular enthusiasm.[1] Following 1948, Israeli law provided for compensation or the return of land for any exiled Palestinians who returned to Israel proper and took an oath to the state. This does not justify the actions of Israel in their entirety, but the tragedy of the Palestinian people is partially of their own making, and if one accepts the principles of the right of return, then the creation of Israeli settlements furthers this on the Israeli side. Furthermore, it calls into question what, if any legal claim the Palestinians can have to any land on the basis of a UN partition plan they rejected, and on the basis of principles and practices they themselves have subverted.

An opinion poll of residents of all 19 Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem conducted in 2011 showed opposition to a transfer of control to the Palestinian Authority. 40% said that they would move to Israel if their neighbourhood was transferred to the Palestinian Authority, and 39% believed most of their neighbour’s preferred Israeli citizenship. On the other hand only 29% would move to a Palestinian neighbourhood if theirs remained in Israel, and 31% estimated that most of their neighbours preferred Palestinian citizenship. 35% prefer Israeli citizenship compared to 30% preferring Palestinian citizenship, with 30% not knowing or not answering.

Before the invasion of Gaza, there was one (read: ONE!!) civilian death from Hamas rockets [see earlier sources]. Hardly an existential threat to Israel. 2) Hamas was weakening before Israel invaded, losing political capital among the Palestinian masses and losing key allies in Syria and Egypt. This invasion has only galvanized support for Hamas, increasing any risk they pose [1]. 3) The only way to prevent future conflict is a two-state solution that gives Palestinians a legitimate government and equal rights as Israelis, with a lifted embargo and economic growth [2].

Cons job will be to suggest an alternative solution that does not increase the risk of harm to Israel, Israeli citizens, or the Jewish People. This debates definition of unreasonable includes, but is not limited to, anything that results in that. My opening points assume three options for Israel: 1) Assimilate the West Bank. This would mean annexation, and full Israeli citizenship for all occupants. It seems highly unlikely that the Palestinians would agree to this, and the average Palestinian would probably reject citizenship. Even if this were not so, it would be highly unsafe to assimilate an openly aggressive population into the country. Even if this were not so, Israel would likely risk losing its Jewish majority, and be subject to an the whims of a historically unfriendly regional Arab majority. 2) Two state solution. This proposes an Palestinian state in the West Bank. The trouble with this is that Israel could not safely defend itself from its 1967 borders, and no one who could make a lasting commitment to Israeli security from a potential state will make one. Israel could withdraw to newly drawn, defensible borders, but such a move would mean annexing certain parts of the West Bank, an illegal move that would likely provoke war with neighboring Arab states without impossible-to-get Palestinian approval. 3) Population shifts.

Some things to take note of: Firstly, the church is entirely separate from the government (ergo the establishment and free exercise clauses). Just as the government has no right to encroach upon the church, the church has no right to encroach upon the government. As such, legality is not contingent upon church approval or disapproval. Laws are not dictated by the church just as the church is not dictated by the law. Secondly, marriage is recognized by the government -and it is regulated. While marriage may have originated as a religious institution it is not now, in a legal sense. It is a contractual one -one within the legislative reach of the government. My opponent's case: RC1) The church's right to discriminate is not challenged, undermined, or in any way jeopardized by the legalization of gay marriage. Marriage, in a legal sense, can be performed in a court house, by a magistrate or by an ordained minister who has been given the authority by the state to marry people. Because the church and the government are and ought to be separate, legalizing gay marriage does not require the church to recognize gay marriage or perform them. RC2) Yes, the bible says a lot of things. Just like my opponent has already pointed out, the government and the church are entirely distinct entities.

If it is banned then it is hurting people, and if it is legalized then it isn't hurting anyone. C2: Banning gay marriage is against human rights. Every person is born with the equal human rights which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Yet, banning gay marriage goes against to of these fundamental rights.

It greatly depends how electronics are employed: if a life is spent playing video games, it would result in very little (or no) increase in utility; but if one were to spend a lifetime applying technology (an extension of electronics) to the directed pursuit of maximizing the good for all, it would carry the potential to increase overall utility much more than if that person were to spend their life exercising.

As Stanley Kurtz discovered in a study of Norway, where gay marriage is legal, 'an extraordinary 82.7% of first-born children' in one specific county were born out of wedlock; he goes on to explain 'many of these births are to unmarried, but cohabitating, couples'. Yet, without the bonds of marriage, such couples are two to three times more likely to break up and leave children thereafter to cope with estranged parents1. The most conservative religious counties in Norway, in comparison, 'have by far the lowest rates' of out-of-wedlock births1. The legalization of gay marriage and the, often concurrent, ban on clergy eager to discourage the practise of out-of-wedlock only serves to undermine the institution of marriage; and it is the children that pay the price. 1 Kurtz, S.

Homosexual relationships are increasingly gaining acceptance in this country; however, these couples have not been permitted to marry. Some states have considered a new form of commitment called a ""civil union"", which essentially is marriage without using the word ""marriage"". Many politicians have said they are against gay marriage but think it should be left up to the states to decide. However, the ""full faith and credit"" clause of the Constitution says that if one state makes a law, other states must recognize it. Thus, if one state allows a gay marriage and that couple moves to another state, the other state must recognize that marriage. This in effect allows one state to make same-sex marriage legal in the entire country. Many politicians are calling for amendments to their state constitution or the U.S. Constitution.

It greatly depends how electronics are employed: if a life is spent playing video games, it would result in very little (or no) increase in utility; but if one were to spend a lifetime applying technology (an extension of electronics) to the directed pursuit of maximizing the good for all, it would carry the potential to increase overall utility much more than if that person were to spend their life exercising. Of course you can balance both exercise and electronics, but the question is which is better? If you were to advocate exercise for each individual--heck lets go a step further and mandate daily exercise--you would do a great amount of good.

In Justice Scalla’s oral argument he stated “isn't it perfectly plausible, indeed reasonable, to assume that since the framers knew that the way militias were destroyed by tyrants in the past was not by passing a law against militias, but by taking away the people's weapons -- that was the way militias were destroyed. The two clauses go together beautifully: Since we need a militia, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.”9 Guns are necessary to prevent the disarming of the people and as a statement that the citizens of the U.S. are allowed to stand up against the state. In the formation of the state, the citizens of the state give up their freedoms and their ability to do violence upon each other in favour a state monopoly on violence. The implication is that the state, through this monopoly on violence, then prevents citizens from doing violence against one another. However, it is possible for the state to use its monopoly on physical force in a reckless or subversive fashion. This means that the citizens should always be able to reassert the primacy of their rights and independence over the state, should the state begin to deviate from its mandated role as protector of those rights. The right to carry firearms is part of this ability to assert one’s power over the state. However, as the state has become more powerful, ownership of small arms has become an increasingly symbolic gesture. Taking away the right to bear arms from any American is thus harmful, as it removes the symbol that the state’s power is not absolute and that ultimately the state is subservient to its people.10  ",-0.4466542626979497,True,1.0983470221578462,1.0841693271150563,-0.005535706803004607,294,True,0.845366069160709

I think discrimination against sexual orientation is morally wrong but it is not illegal. There should not be a surprise that discrimination against someone's sexual orientation is happening. But that would be a hard legal case to prove. When I go down the street I can see if someone is a Caucasian American or an African American. I can distinctively observe if someone is a man or woman (hopefully). Also if someone is wearing a hijab, I might assume they are a Muslim. If a man is wearing a Yamaka, I will assume he is Jewish. But when I go down the street I can not know if someone is a homosexual or not. I can have my assumptions but why would I suspect it unless they reveal it. This is why discrimination against sexual orientation is hard case to prove. You have to show that the person discriminating actually knows the other persons' sexual orientation and intends on discriminating because of it. Nevertheless, discriminating against sexual orientation is not illegal as you falsely claim. Sexual orientation is not covered under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

19,5,10609,"In this case, I do agree with my opponent to some degree in that sexuality is a birth trait, however, I do not agree that is a ""mental defect"" as my opponent so blatantly put it. I propose that there is a biological component to sexuality, however it is not a choice, and is not just a LGBTQI thing, this is a human thing, a biological human trait. Sexuality is about so much more than just sex. Sexuality also encompasses how one feels about their body, their biological sex, one's gender, one's gender identity, one's sexual orientation, one's sexual behaviors, one's values and attitudes toward sexual relationships, and any desires or fantasies or sexual preferences. This also does not include just the LGBTQI community; this also includes heterosexual individuals. Sexuality is a human trait; it is a part of everyone's life to some degree. The DSM-IV, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders which is produced by the American Psychiatric Association, defines a mental defect as, ""mental retardation, brain damage or other biological dysfunction that is associated with distress or disability causing symptoms or impairment in at least one important area of an individual's functioning.""

We should also take into note the number of bisexuals and people who are reluctant to admit themselves as homosexuals on these studies.
